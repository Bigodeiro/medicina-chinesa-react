Wei. It is a shallow syndrome of wind cold syndrome and belongs to the original disease of wind cold. It can be roughly divided into three types: external syndrome internal syndrome and external internal syndrome.

Therefore it can be roughly divided into yang deficiency and yin deficiency. Yin deficiency often carries internal heat or due to the prolonged accumulation of heat due to wind and cold it leads to a febrile disease of less yin and qi. Therefore there are also mixed periods of cold and heat.

The disease is caused by kidney deficiency which cannot nourish the liver leading to the onset of liver wind. It is caused by kidney deficiency and liver wind. The ancients compared it to water not containing wood resulting in the withering of wood and the generation of wind. This is because the kidney yin is not enough to nourish the liver and wood and yin deficiency leads to wind movement. However the kidney is an organ of water and fire. Insufficient kidney water can also lead to a lack of love for yin and yang. Kidney yang cannot be replaced by yin but gradually dissipates. The deficiency of kidney yang leads to yang deficiency and wind movement which was referred to by ancient people as deficiency wind and dark movement. In addition the liver is a viscera that stores blood. Liver blood deficiency is insufficient to nourish and can also cause liver dryness and wind movement which is a syndrome of blood deficiency and wind generation. Therefore there is a syndrome of liver and kidney deficiency and wind movement with Yin deficiency and wind movement being the most common and there are also many cases of blood deficiency and wind movement. In the later stage of the disease there are also cases of Yang deficiency and wind movement. Liver and kidney deficiency wind is a disease that often occurs between clearing and clearing the orifices and meridians. In mild cases it can cause headaches and dizziness in severe cases it can cause paralysis tremors wind prickly heat wind paralysis and wind epilepsy. In acute cases it can cause stroke dysentery and syncope. In mild cases it can cause symptoms such as flaccidity Bi and hair loss. The wind of liver and kidney deficiency is always caused by the first deficiency of the liver and kidney and then the internal movement of the liver wind. Therefore the treatment principle is to mainly nourish the deficiency of the liver and kidney and for yin deficiency nourishing yin and softening the liver to quench the wind; Those with blood deficiency should nourish the blood and moisten the liver to quench the wind; People with kidney yang deficiency should also warm and nourish the kidney yang to quench the wind which also implies that yang generates yin and grows. Zhang Jingyue said "Those who are good at nourishing yin should seek yin from yang." This is to help yang and also to prolong yin. Yin is calm and yang is secret and internal wind cannot rise so warming yang can also quench the wind.

Therefore although the treatment principles should all supplement deficiency to quench wind there is a certain emphasis on supplementing qi nourishing blood nourishing yin and assisting yang; But taking liver blood and spleen qi as the foundation is to benefit qi and blood while suppressing liver wind and should also be the main method for treating liver spleen deficiency wind syndrome. Especially with tonifying the spleen and supplementing qi as the top priority not only can one maintain a healthy temper but one can also soothe the liver and numbness; Moreover supplementing qi can generate blood as the ancients said: tangible blood originates from intangible qi; Bloodblood can nourish the liver but if the liver is nourished the internal wind cannot rise and the deficiency wind will self extinguish.",tongueConditionList:["Tongue is red and without moss","Tongue with red fur and thin yellow fur","Moist tongue","Thin moss and light texture"],pulseConditionList:["Pulse string fineness","wire and frequent pulse","relaxed and soft pulse"]},{id:19,name:"Spleen and kidney deficiency wind syndrome",symptoms:["Low back soreness and fatigue","Low back pain as if broken","Sweating out evil wind","Limb soreness","Eating less and thinking less","Urgent and loose stools","Little Deutzia sometimes has a delay","Emaciated body","headache","Insomnia","Tinnitus and dizziness","At times clear water flows like a spring","Regurgitation","be anxious to vomit","Cold convulsion of lower limbs","Abdominal distension and nausea","dizziness and blurred vision","To see things as if they were spinning","Close your eyes and it will be slightly slower","Binaural tinnitus","Frontal pain","A splitting headache","Sudden fall twice","Clear mind","After a few hours as usual","Sleeping at night with many dreams"],description:"Spleen and kidney deficiency wind syndrome is commonly seen in frail individuals or those who have been ill for a long time.

If the yang of the lung and kidney is deficient the yang of the health is not fixed and external cold is also prone to attack people. Either the upper part of the lung is depressed or the lower jiao directly sinks and people are affected by the kidney; The combination of internal and external pathogens is particularly severe for diseases Either up against the lungs or down against the kidneys. Mild cases can lead to stagnation while severe cases can lead to stagnation of yang qi. Dramatic cases can cause kidney yang to float over leading to fainting and detachment. The cold syndrome of lung and kidney deficiency originates from yang deficiency so its treatment principle should be based on warming and tonifying the yang qi of the lung and kidney. Its origin lies in the deficiency of kidney yang so warming and tonifying kidney yang is particularly important; If the kidney yang is restored the water will not be cold and the gold will not be cold; The kidney is the same house as water and fire and the lung is responsible for clearing the fluid. If the temperature and dryness are too high it can harm the kidney water and lung fluid. Therefore in addition to warming and tonifying the lung and kidney yang deficiency it is also important to protect the kidney water and lung fluid so as not to have the worry of aiding yang and damaging yin.",tongueConditionList:["Mild white tongue with little moss"],pulseConditionList:["Pulse is dull delayed and weak","The pulse is deep thin and slight"]},{id:35,name:"Lung Wei Feng Heat Syndrome",symptoms:["a stuffy feeling in the chest","abundant phlegm","cough","epigastric fullness","Not hungry","quadriplegia","Paralysis and convulsion","Aversion to cold fever and no sweating","Slightly cold and hot","Fear of wind","Body heat and bloating","Fever and sweating","Restlessness","oliguria with reddish urine","Inducing thirst and drinking","headache","Dizziness","Distending headache","Item strong inversion","Pharyngeal pain and phlegm accumulation","cough","Inducing thirst and vomiting immediately"],description:'The Lung Wei Wind Heat Syndrome is a mild syndrome of the cold wind evil carrying heat in the summer month. Lei Shaoyi said "When the heat wind is absorbed from the mouth and nose it must first invade the lungs. The lungs control the qi as the defense and if the lung is depressed it cannot defend the qi. Therefore the Lung Wei is the first to bear the brunt." Wind stagnation is in the Wei and heat accumulation is in the lungs. Those who feel the onset of new evil are referred to as experiencing heat or injuring the heat; Alternatively those who have already absorbed the heat pathogen and have a mild or shallow accumulation can be triggered by external wind pathogens which are also caused by the same disease as wind and heat. They are called Taiyin Fushu or Fushu late onset which can occur between late summer and early autumn. The heat source carries dampness and those with a heavy accumulation of dampness can also be called dampness turbidity. Wind evil carries heat stagnation in the Wei is the external syndrome stagnation in the lungs is the internal syndrome stagnation in the upper jiao loss of clear qi in the appropriate expansion external obstruction of qi in the Xuanda internal qi in the Xuanda and both external and internal symptoms.

It is a syndrome of wind induced heat that triggers the internal heat accumulation and is a complication of wind and heat. Therefore it is called the syndrome of heat induced wind and cold or cold stagnation and heat which is also an example of cold enveloping fire. It can be seen from the new feeling of the summer moon that those with severe heat are called heat warmth while those with severe dampness are called heat pollution and heat dampness. It can also be seen in late onset of summer heat in autumn or in combination with fever and cold. The lung stomach wind heat syndrome is a combination of exterior and interior diseases. Those who are biased towards the surface are affected by wind and cold outside and have multiple symptoms of camp and defense; Those who lean towards the inner side tend to have more symptoms of middle qi. Among them those with a strong emphasis on wind and evil are known as Qi clearing and other phenomena. Those who suffer from severe cold and evil are the Qing Yang lords. If the heat is severe it indicates symptoms of lung stomach and qi. The pathogenesis of the lung stomach wind heat syndrome still belongs to the syndrome of wind evil and external stagnation while heat and internal steaming are the symptoms of external stagnation and internal steaming; External depression cannot be resolved and internal steaming must not be eliminated. Therefore its treatment principle should still be pungent fragrance to promote yang and dispersing wind and cold outside to indicate depression; Mild and refreshing with a clear heat inside to relieve internal steaming; It is necessary to open the surface and dissipate the wind so that the heat can be released and resolved. He Lianchen said "First let him sweat slightly to relieve the new cold in the external bundle; then let him gently spread the cool and light to clear and benefit; if the remaining evil remains unsolved let him use the spicy cool and fragrant fragrance to clear it."

The onset of the disease is sudden and dangerous with a sudden onset of closed syncope. Therefore the term "heat wind" refers to the movement of heat and wind also known as heatstroke or heatstroke syncope. Children with weak constitution are most likely to suffer from this syndrome which is similar to infantile convulsion and is also known as acute convulsion. Cheng Xingxuan said "The cause of the disease is heat generated by summer wind and heat generates shock." However it is not convulsion. The heart and liver are all based on blood circulation. When wind and heat affect the heart and liver it must accumulate in blood circulation and there must be multiple blood circulation and Qi and blood diseases; Evil entrapment and blood stasis multiple and severe diseases and difficult to fully resolve cause sudden closure of internal orifices sudden movement of liver wind spasms and seizures. Therefore Cheng Xingxuan said "Heat is fond of sadness wind is fond of hurting the liver. The heart and liver are internal organs and the internal organs are hidden. Although the evil is difficult to remove it is difficult to recover." Therefore the heart liver wind heat syndrome is characterized by acute and severe onset but treatment is difficult to achieve quick results. For those with solid physical condition Cheng claimed that the top ten can save seven or eight indicating that weak individuals are extremely difficult to rescue. The heart liver heat wind syndrome is originally characterized by a change of external depression and internal redness. The condition is severe and acute with slight delay leading to collapse and transformation. The method of treatment is to disperse the cold and depression on the surface when urgent so that internal heat can have a way out. By clearing and cooling the heat the heat inside can be quickly transmitted to the outside avoiding the risk of trapping and causing the mouth to close and move due to wind.',tongueConditionList:["Moss white and greasy","yelow coating of the tongue","fklushed tongue","maroon color of the tongue","Crimson crimson","Moss thin yellow","Moss stem"],pulseConditionList:["High fever without sweating","Strong pulse count","wire and frequent pulse","thready and rapid pulse"]},{id:38,name:"Syndrome of lung and stomach heat dampness",symptoms:["Body Pain Bone Joint Disease Chu","Limb joint soreness","Aversion to cold","Urine has been sprinkled without a trace","Body heaviness","Fever without sweat","Aversion to wind","Peribody Epidemic Chu","Muscle heat like burning","afternoon fever","Thirst with no desire to drink","oliguria with reddish urine","Stomach pain during defecation","Stool closure","diarrhea with loose stools","Defecation and diarrhea","Eyes red and upset","Dry front plate teeth","Headache like a bundle","Dizziness","Thoracic diaphragm fullness","abdominal fullness","epigastric fullness","Feeling stuffy and not hungry","Vomiting","Nausea","I can't see anymore","Deafness","yellowish sclera","Pharyngeal itching"],description:"The lung and stomach heat dampness syndrome is characterized by heat evil carrying dampness. It is inhaled from the mouth and nose with the nose passing through the lungs and the mouth passing through the stomach. Therefore when heat dampness is absorbed the lung and stomach first receive it which is commonly referred to as the heat qi receiving upwards. Mild cases with mild symptoms are referred to as heat stroke syndrome severe cases with acute symptoms are referred to as heat stroke syndrome those with lingering heat are referred to as heat warmth and those with turbid qi are referred to as heat defilement. These are all newly felt heat diseases. If heat and dampness first lie in the lungs and stomach and occur due to the sensation of cold dampness or warm pathogenic factors they are all called late onset of heat and dampness and there are different types of heat and dampness. The syndrome of lung and stomach heat dampness always manifests in the upper and middle qi fractions. For those with severe dampness dampness is the evil of yin and turbidity which will inevitably suppress the upper jiao and clear yang. In some cases the yang qi will be blocked and the heat will not reach the outside. However if the inner tunnel is closed it will become a dangerous and severe syndrome. For those with severe heat stroke it is a yang evil. It first depresses the upper energizer and clears qi and then inevitably damages the burning fluid. In some cases it can cause internal steaming of blood. Its transformation or subsidence or internal closure is also often reversed. The pathogenesis of lung and stomach heat dampness syndrome is always stagnation and suppression of the upper jiao qi mechanism. Therefore its treatment principle should always be based on the principle of spicy cool and fragrant and the appropriate expansion of the upper jiao qi mechanism. It is important to promote the expansion of clear qi clear up turbidity and lower it. Then the dampness opens and heat penetrates and the heat dampness resolves itself.

It is a syndrome of lung and spleen heat dampness. Both the lungs and spleen are the main organs of qi so they are known as heat damaging the vital energy or damp heat damaging the qi. Both the lungs and spleen belong to the Tai Yin so they are also known as heat damaging the Tai Yin. In ancient times they were said to drink in the sun and the lungs were the main source of health. In the case of typhoid fever the camp and health were the boundary of the sun and the ancient nickname for drinking heat was also the syndrome of heat damaging the lung and spleen. The syndrome of heat dampness in the lungs and spleen can also be classified as severe heat or dampness; For those with severe heat stroke the injury is shallow and only results in a distinction between moderate and clear qi; Those with severe dampness often carry the yin and cold qi causing severe injuries that can lead to the development of middle qi. Lei Shaoyi said "Heat injury to the Taiyin difficulty in temper and imbalance in ascending and descending" is a syndrome of heat injury to the lungs and spleen which can lead to the clearing of yang qi and the loss of its ability to ascend clear and lower turbidity. The imbalance in ascending and descending is its main pathogenesis. The syndrome of lung and spleen heat dampness with severe heat stroke often carries foul and turbid qi. Therefore its treatment principle should be refreshing fragrant cool and mild to relieve heat stroke and dissipate dampness; Aroma to dispel impurities light penetration to promote dampness and stagnation. For those with heavy dampness they often carry yin and cold qi and their treatment should be based on the combination of spicy and warm qi with fragrant and mild qi and the main method is to promote the circulation of yang qi on the surface and inside.

Therefore there is a name for heat dampness cholera or heat stroke cholera and those who cannot vomit or diarrhea are called Commonly known as colic. For those with severe heat stroke their illness is relatively shallow and only stagnates in the Qi component which is particularly prone to heat transformation and consumes qi and liquid. For those with severe dampness the disease is deep and has already stagnated in the Yang branch damaging the Yang qi leading to a change in the closure and detachment of the Yang qi.

Those who are born in the midst of summer and have a hot and foul atmosphere are called hot and foul; When it occurs during the plum rain it is called moldy dampness; There are also cases of heat stroke with phlegm left in the gallbladder and stomach which is called heat stroke due to qi deficiency. Often carrying the wood fire in the gallbladder and rebelling recklessly. The heat filth dampness and turbidity of qi are absorbed through the mouth and nose traveling straight through the middle path obscuring the upper and middle clear qi and cannot be spread inside and outside.

The initial disease is often characterized by both external and internal factors; Wind damages the lungs dampness belongs to the spleen and both the lungs and spleen belong to the Tai Yin. The ancients referred to it as Tai Yin rheumatism or Tai Yin cold or Tai Yin stroke. The pathogenesis of lung and spleen rheumatism syndrome is mainly characterized by stagnation and suppression of the qi of clearing yang in the upper jiao. If clearing yang is not suitable for expansion it cannot occur in the striae on the outside and does not control the rise and fall of the lung and spleen on the inside. Therefore it is a common disease on the surface and inside. If the lung qi does not decrease it cannot flow its body fluid for the spleen to descend the waterway; If one\'s temper does not rise one\'s health luck will be negligent; Rheumatism carries moisture and qi which leads down the large intestine to cause depression and depression; Edema due to stasis due to extravasation of the striae muscle; Staying stagnant in the camp and guard is a rash; Staying in the tendons and veins resulting in blockage of the collaterals and stagnation of qi and blood resulting in flaccidity. The treatment of lung spleen rheumatism syndrome involves two methods: external evacuation and infiltration in order to decompose its external and internal pathogens. Zhang Zhongjing said "A stroke in the Taiyin region can cause sweating " which is a method of clearing the yang and muscles to penetrate the pathogenic factors of rheumatism. Wu Kun\'an on the other hand said: "Dampness evil lies on the surface of muscle drive and it is suitable to relieve muscle infiltration and dampness."

Wind energy is transmitted to the liver while dampness is attributed to the spleen. Those who are shallow in depth are still in the Qi division.

Rheumatism affects the liver and kidneys and often affects the muscles and bones causing pain to become arthralgia; The liver follows the hypochondrium and the kidneys are located at the waist. Both the liver and kidneys are responsible for the foot and knee and are related to the anterior yin. Therefore its symptoms are more common in the waist hypochondrium back foot knee or anterior yin; However the liver is mainly responsible for blood circulation and the Wei originates from the lower energizer.

Yu Genchu referred to it as cold and epidemic which occurs before the autumnal equinox with filthy dampness and is also an example of cold and dampness. In summer when it occurs due to excessive coolness it is commonly known as Yin Sha; Fetal malaria in children also has symptoms of lung and stomach cold dampness. Due to the accumulation of cold and dampness in the lungs and stomach it is often caused by mistakenly administering cold and causing yin coagulation. Cold and dampness stagnation occurs in the lungs and stomach first suppressing the yang qi of the upper and middle jiao. The lungs and stomach are occupied by the clear yang qi which is lost in the spreading of the clear yang qi and cannot pass through the barrier and the Wei yang cannot be cleared resulting in the surface syndrome of cold and dampness in the lungs and stomach; The inability to promote the qi lowering mechanism within and the inability to clear and clear the orifices above can result in external and internal symptoms of lung stomach cold and dampness.

In the summer moon it is also known as Yin heat stroke also known as typhoid fever or cold fever. Its symptoms may include diarrhea dysentery cholera malaria jaundice and other miscellaneous diseases. Cold dampness suppresses the lungs and spleen and the qi of clearing yang in the upper and middle cannot be spread inside and outside. On the outside the Wei Yang is lost in propaganda while on the inside the Qi mechanism is lost and should be lowered.

It is often caused by excessive consumption of raw and cold fruits tea wine and other substances which can damage the spleen and stomach yang qi cannot transport and transform water and stagnates into dampness. It is an endogenous dampness; Or more susceptible to external cold the combination of internal and external pathogenic factors can lead to internal injury cold and dampness; The onset of the disease varies in severity. Those with acute symptoms are called moderate dampness also known as moderate cold while those with mild symptoms are called dampness filthy dampness and latent dampness. Cold and dampness accumulate in the middle energizer with the most frequent symptoms of transformation. Urgent symptoms can lead to diarrhea dysentery and cholera while mild symptoms can lead to symptoms such as jaundice malaria swelling bloating and bloody stools making it the most complex syndrome in cold and dampness syndrome. Therefore when urgent there is a risk of blackout while when slow there is a change in stubborn nature. Cold dampness and yin evil can cause damage to the yang qi of the spleen and stomach when the person is in the middle energizer. In mild cases the qi of the spleen and stomach is stagnant and clear and cannot be conveyed inside and outside. Instead it is an internal syndrome that combines external and internal symptoms and is a common disease between external and internal symptoms; If it is severe it will cause the spleen yang to be unable to circulate its body fluid for the stomach and the body fluid cannot transform qi into water resulting in indistinguishable water and grain; Either it passes down the large intestine and becomes diarrhea or dysentery or it stays in the triple energizer and becomes swollen or swollen or it becomes yellow or malaria for a long time; For those who are in a state of urgency they block the yang qi and become a closed syncope with moderate cold and moderate dampness; Or disrupt the clear yang reverse the chaotic qi mechanism confuse the clear and turbid and become a profligate and disorderly cholera. The spleen and stomach cold and dampness syndrome is a pathogenic factor of yin turbidity which leads to the transformation of yang qi in stagnation. Therefore its treatment principle should first warm and unblock the spleen and stomach yang qi with the main focus on dispersing cold and dampness; When the middle yang vibrates it can stir up the qi of clearing yang causing external wrinkles internal waterways and internal decomposition; If the cold and dampness are eliminated the clear yang will rise while the turbid yin will decrease.

Both the liver and spleen are mainly responsible for blood circulation so it can cause stagnation of blood circulation and become a disease of arthralgia and pain. If the internal stagnation of cold and dampness occurs or if it occurs in the spleen then the liver wood will multiply in the spleen causing stomach pain abdominal pain diarrhea jaundice swelling and other diseases; Or if it stagnates in the liver the spleen dampness will be suppressed in the liver causing the liver's vitality to stagnate and the liver's yang to stagnate leading to syncope; Or gynecological diseases such as menstrual pain amenorrhea and yin blowing.

In addition to feeling seasonal dampness heat it includes heat pollution mold dampness dampness and turbidity foul and foul qi malaria and sha qi. There are also warm diseases with dampness such as wind temperature spring temperature winter temperature as well as typhoid and sha summer wind with dampness and turbidity and heat injury with food. In addition the dampness and heat transformation such as dampness and summer heat are all caused by dampness heat in the lung and stomach. Therefore there are many sources of this disease and its symptoms are also complex. The evil of dampness and heat originates from the mouth and nose and first accumulates in the upper jiao. It suppresses the qi of clearing yang and prevents it from producing external striae while regulating the qi mechanism internally. Therefore dampness and heat in the lungs and stomach are often characterized by a combination of external and internal factors. Those with a strong emphasis on heat and evil will experience stagnation and stagnation of qi; Those with a heavy emphasis on dampness and evil will inevitably experience stagnation and yang suppression both of which are symptoms of dampness suppressing heat and steaming. If one is unable to overcome depression it can turn into stagnation. Stagnation persists either against the top trapped in the bottom or trapped in the middle and even transforms into symptoms of stagnation or syncope. If the stagnation of heat persists for a long time it will turn into a period of accumulation of steam and accumulation of heat. It can cause damage to the body and consume fluids and in some cases it can deeply divide the body\'s blood while qi and blood are both steamed together; Or go deep into the Yin division and eliminate the burning of Yin fluid resulting in a state of Qi and Yin steaming together. If the actor consumes gas and liquid it can also cause a change of detachment. The transmission and transformation of the latent evil originating from within are somewhat similar but they are also mostly due to the entanglement of the Qi component which is difficult to quickly resolve and can easily penetrate into the blood and Yin components. This is slightly different from the new sense of evil. The treatment principle for lung stomach dampness heat syndrome is as follows: the initial disease should be mild and bitter and the upper jiao qi should be released to reach pathogenic factors; For a long time it will be bitter bitter and cool while for a light time it will be beneficial and sunny. In addition aroma is essential for resolving turbidity bitter warmth is essential for dryness and dampness bitterness is essential for relieving heat and sweetness is essential for promoting diuresis in the lung and stomach dampness heat syndrome. The pathogenesis of dampness and heat stagnation in the lung and stomach is always related to the qi of clearing yang in the upper energizer. Therefore the first step is to release the qi of the upper energizer and once the yang is cleared it can reach the muscle striae on the outside to relieve symptoms while on the inside it can promote the qi and flow through the waterways. This is the method of Wu Jutong\'s "Xuanhua Quxie still from the surface". Therefore Ye Lin said "If the surface is not clear it should not be clear. It is appropriate to declare the division of qi." Wu Kun\'an said "The evil of dampness is obstructed by the division of qi and heat comes from dampness. Only using heat clearing drugs should not be used. It is appropriate to separate dampness from qi and heat should be eliminated by itself." He Lianchen also said; The main method is to gently clear and open the lungs with the lungs governing the entire body\'s qi. The transformation of lung qi leads to the spontaneous transformation of spleen dampness. As long as the ventilation is separated the qi is divided into dampness and dampness is removed and heat is self stopped.

However it is common to have both external and internal symptoms such as external dampness heat causing the disease and internal dampness evil transforming into warmth and heat causing the disease to occur in the lung and spleen. Therefore in the early stage of dampness heat there is also this syndrome where dampness heat does not resolve or becomes yellow due to stagnation and steaming or subsides and becomes diarrhea or stagnates and causes water to overflow due to muscle obstruction or stagnates and becomes flaccidity due to passage obstruction. The dampness and heat stagnation of the lung and spleen can initially suppress the qi of clearing yang in the upper and middle parts of the body. Clearing yang cannot be propagated and it is not suitable to have striae on the outside. The qi lowering mechanism cannot be propagated on the inside and the descending water channel can facilitate the circulation of the three jiao; Damp and hot steaming either steamed outside left in the middle or trapped below hot steaming outside still has the potential to reach outside; Those who remain in the middle stagnate the qi mechanism and block it inside; Even if the body fluid is stagnant it stops and melts into water overflows on the skin muscles and knees and is stored inside the membrane and outside the intestine it is difficult to quickly remove. The dampness and heat stagnation of the lungs and spleen prevents the release of the upper and middle clear yang qi. Therefore the treatment principle should always be to release the upper and middle clear yang qi as the main source and the external area can be affected by striae allowing the dampness and heat to escape from sweat; The internal waterways can be used to promote dampness and heat from a young age. Xie Yinglu said "Sweating can promote water retention and the evil of Buddha\'s depression can be resolved both externally and internally." He Lianchen also said "The treatment method is mainly to gently open the lung qi which controls the whole body\'s qi.

The dampness heat syndrome of the gallbladder and stomach is often caused by the sensation of heat dampness and turbidity. It is inhaled through the mouth and nose runs straight through the middle channel and accumulates in the source of energy. It starts from the collapse of Shaoyang and in cases of severe dampness it often suppresses the pivot mechanism and loses its ability to pivot.

The pathogenesis of lung liver dampness heat syndrome is characterized by dampness stagnation on the outside and heat retention on the inside. Therefore its treatment principle should always be to promote the transformation of dampness evil clear and penetrate the dampness evil so that the dampness evil suppressed by stagnation can be opened and the evil accumulated in the qi camp can be thoroughly resolved; Cao Bingzhang said "First release dampness and heat then penetrate from the inside to the outside This heat is trapped inside dampness is suppressed outside and there are many symptoms such as summer heat autumn plague and autumn dryness. The treatment method for this syndrome is to use silkworm excrement talcum Gualou skin and Yu Jin to dissipate turbidity and promote qi and qi stagnation. Fresh ground fermented soybeans artemisia annua white wei and Jiaoshan gardenia are used to clear and nourish heat from the outside and dampness and heat are transmitted. Feces come from the bottom and Xiaozi is also long. If you misuse Jingjie Fangfang Zhizhi and Pu it will increase chest tightness and retching.

Internal injury dampness evil such as overeating gaoliang wine meat tea and fruits can accumulate dampness and accumulate in the middle energizer which lingers in the spleen and stomach and causes the disease. Exogenous seasonal dampness and heat such as summer dampness filth mold dampness and scab are new pathogenic factors. Feeling without emitting accumulating in the interior transforming into warmth and heat such as dampness heatstroke and dampness is considered to suppress evil. The onset of seasonal evils is often caused by both external and internal diseases; The onset of dampness and heat caused by internal injuries is often associated with external seasonal pathogens combined with internal and external pathogens and is often a miscellaneous disease; Especially common are diarrhea dysentery cholera abdominal distension and pain which often transform into acute and chronic miscellaneous diseases such as jaundice swelling bloating malaria bloating flaccidity and arthralgia. It is a syndrome of dampness and heat in the spleen and stomach and the diseases it belongs to are also very widespread. Exogenous new pathogens run directly from the mouth and nose to the middle channel accumulating in the middle jiao. They are combined with internal dampness to suppress the spleen and stomach causing the loss of the power to ascend and descend the middle qi. The ability to clear yang is lost and the ability to promote and expand qi cannot be promoted externally. The internal cannot promote and lower qi so there are many mixed symptoms on the surface and inside. The pathogenesis changes either due to Buddha stagnation in the interior stagnation in the interior inversion in the upper part stagnation in the lower part or stagnation in the middle and even disorder in ascending and descending confusion in clearing and turbidity blockage of the middle yang all of which are changes of the same disease on the surface and inside. The dampness and heat caused by internal injuries can stagnate in the stomach resulting in a disharmony of stomach qi. In some cases the disharmony of the stomach can lead to a downward trend and an upward trend leading to stagnation in the stomach meridians and loss of its circulation; If it stagnates in the spleen it will lose its normal health and circulation unable to distinguish between water and grain secreting clear and turbid fluids causing dereliction of circulation and transformation or stagnation in the middle or internal organs all of which are acute and chronic miscellaneous diseases. The treatment of spleen and stomach dampness heat syndrome is always based on dredging the middle energizer and clearing away dampness and heat. Pu Fuzhou said "Clearing dampness and heat regulating the spleen and stomach dredging the three jiao and using bitter and spicy herbs." Ye Tianshi once said "Dampness and heat are not bitter spicy cold and insoluble." However those with a heavy degree of dampness and turbidity are not bitter bitter spicy warm and dry and cannot pass through yang and dissipate turbidity; For those who suffer from food stagnation it is better to dredge up the energy and focus on food stagnation; For those who suffer from both deficiency and deficiency they should also support the spleen to assist in its movement and transformation. Ma Yuanyi once said "The internal injury of qi is sufficient to cause yin and evil and the attack is sufficient to cause qi damage. The appropriate way to supplement it is to stagnate evil." It also said "If you supplement deficiency the heat will not be removed and if you treat evil the deficiency will not be taken care of."

The dampness heat flows from the middle jiao to the lower jiao resulting in a combination of the middle and lower jiao. It can also be inhaled by a new sensation causing turbid dampness heat to pass directly through the middle canal to the human stomach or due to the accumulation of dampness and heat which occurs when the yang ming is not resolved and then flows into the intestines. Therefore it is known as the dampness blocking qi mechanism or the dampness accumulating in the lower jiao. In miscellaneous diseases diarrhea and dysentery are more common and can also develop into bloating or malaria. Gastrointestinal dampness heat syndrome the evil of dampness heat originates from the stomach and intestines and when it is in contact with the water and grains in the stomach it often contains food and phlegm; Combined with intestinal waste it becomes stagnant; Those with severe heat tend to stagnate in the Qi component blocking the gastrointestinal Qi mechanism and even causing damage to the blood component due to Qi; Those with heavy dampness often carry external cold causing depression to damage yang qi; If the evil is severe it is often associated with phlegm food and dross accumulation and is more entangled. Damp heat flows from the stomach to the intestines competing with the water and grains in the stomach and the dross in the intestines. It is mostly solid evil and difficult to penetrate from the outside. It must be a false intestinal tract as a way out and the evil will be eliminated through feces. Yu Genchu said "When bitterness and bitterness are reduced they will be eliminated through feces." Especially for those who suffer from internal collapse of evil they attach themselves to the dross in the intestines and are the most difficult to quickly eliminate. Therefore as the Yu family once said "Evil forces emerge endlessly often slowing down repeatedly and then clearing and benefiting four times and the evil forces begin to dissipate." It also said "Once the accumulated dirt descends five or six times until seven or eight times and the evil forces begin to dissipate. However if dampness and heat do not compete with tangible objects but only hinder the gastrointestinal qi mechanism then the main approach should be to dissipate dampness and ventilate. Although it is called ventilation it also uses the pseudo two intestines as the outlet. Shao Xiangen said "Dampness obstructs the qi mechanism and the treatment is to infiltrate dampness and open qi.

However if the liver qi cannot be released it can also lead to the obstruction of the stomach and the loss of qi leading to the development of liver stomach syndrome. The liver is Jueyin with Shaoyang as the exterior and interior and is the pivot of the main qi mechanism. The liver qi is suppressed by dampness and the pivot mechanism is also affected by the pivot failure. The liver is responsible for storing blood dampness stagnation outside heat steaming inside mostly from qi and blood and Jueyin sends phase fire with dampness and heat steaming causing the phase fire to be unstable in position resulting in the inversion of wood fire; If dampness and heat remain the liver qi will accumulate in the stomach causing the stomach organs to lose their ability to clear and lower.

The spleen is a damp soil mainly responsible for transporting and transforming fluid qi the liver stores fire and mainly deals with blood; Liver numbness is caused by dampness in the spleen and the vitality of the liver is not active which cannot be released to the spleen. The spleen lacks the ability to transport and transform and dampness stagnation is even more severe; Prolonged stagnation transforms heat further carrying the wood fire of the liver resulting in dampness stagnation and heat steaming. The spleen governs the qi of the body while the liver stores blood. If it is biased towards the spleen it is a symptom of stagnation of qi. The liver is characterized by blood stasis and steaming. And the liver is the Jueyin with Shaoyang as the exterior and interior jointly controlling the pivot of the Qi mechanism. Dampness and heat stagnation in the liver can also cause the pivot to rotate disadvantageously. If dampness and evil are severe there will be more stagnation changes. Dampness and heat stagnation in the spleen and the spleen lacks the ability to transport and transform. If the Jin Qi stagnates it will stop storing water; If it is delayed and untreated and water and qi are intertwined it will become a stubborn disease of bloating. Stagnation in the liver leads to the loss of liver qi for relaxation which runs counter to the spleen and stomach and can even cause stagnation of the liver\'s blood vessels often becoming a chronic disease. The dampness heat syndrome of the liver and spleen is often caused by dampness stagnation in the spleen heat stagnation in the liver and dampness suppressing heat stagnation. Therefore its treatment principle is to use bitter and bitter herbs to cool and dilute bitter and bitter herbs to open dampness stagnation and cool and dilute to clear and dissipate heat in dampness. Lei Shaoyi said "Let the dampness in the interior go from urination." He Lianchen said "Those who have not yet melted the fire the bitter and bitter herbs are light and warm; those who have already melted the fire the bitter and bitter herbs are light and clear." For those who have a strong internal fire it should also be combined with the method of clearing and descending so that the stagnant fire can go from the large intestine. For those who engage in blood circulation it is more important to clear and purify the blood circulation so that it can be converted into qi and dissolved. In short dampness and heat stagnate the liver and spleen and the mechanism of liver and spleen qi is lost in relieving stress.

It is milder in comparison to warm heat syndrome and heavier in comparison to wind dryness syndrome. Wind dryness can transform heat into warm dryness and warm dryness can also transform heat into dry heat. It is different from the wind dryness caused by wind heat also known as warm dryness. The disease often occurs in early autumn when the climate is warm and hot and the combination of autumn temperature and autumn dryness becomes a syndrome of warm dryness; Or by autumn warmth or wind dryness excessive administration of Xin San consumption of body fluids and transformation of dryness can also turn into lung and stomach warm dryness. Warmth and dryness can damage the lungs and stomach. First it consumes the lung fluid and stomach fluid causing the stomach to be unable to flow water to the lungs resulting in even drier lung qi; If there is a lack of body fluid in the lungs to apply there will be no mist or dew to irrigate. Therefore although the warming and dryness may damage the upper and middle lungs and stomach the pathological changes lie in the lung\'s fluid qi causing the lungs to lose the right to subdue and then consume gastric fluid. If delayed and untreated again it will eventually damage the yin fluid. In case of urgency it can be forwarded to critical and serious symptoms such as diphtheria. In case of delay it can transform into pulmonary impotence and tuberculosis causing damage to the portal area. Lung-stomach warming dryness syndrome although warming dryness harms the upper and middle lungs and stomach its onset is more common in the lungs as the ancients called "dryness harms the lungs". Therefore its treatment should mainly focus on clearing the lungs and moistening dryness which is the method that Ye Tianshi called "sweet cold moistening and descending to eliminate lung and gold".

Wind dryness and warm dryness cannot be treated and heat is transmitted to the lungs and stomach; The syndrome of heat deficiency caused by the mistake of transforming heat into dryness due to typhoid fever or warm heat which is transmitted from the differentiation of qi in the lungs and stomach as well as the syndrome of heat directly invading the lungs and stomach or the syndrome of excessive temperature heat and dry heat leading to the collapse of yang ming qi can all become this syndrome which is referred to as the yang ming syndrome in the "Treatise on Febrile Diseases" and the syndrome of hand Taiyin warmth and heat qi division dryness heat syndrome and lung stomach dryness heat syndrome. As a pathogenic factor of dryness and heat it is steamed and burned in the upper and middle qi fractions with the main pathogenesis being the elimination and burning of lung and stomach fluids. In mild cases it is steamed in the upper jiao to clear qi and fluid and is subjected to heat steaming; The heavy heat belongs to the middle energizer mainly focused on the stomach and internal organs. Yu Genchu once said "Evil heat is transmitted to the stomach meridian with external muscle striae internal liver and gallbladder upper heart and lung and lower small intestine and bladder. They are all steamed and burned by it but they are scattered and invisible dry heat which has not yet become strong." In the dry heat the body fluid is boiled either burning up and down or forced down or disturbed in the middle and the ascending and descending are disordered mixed with clearing and turbidity resulting in various symptoms such as vomiting diuresis and cholera. Dramatists close their minds internally and suddenly move their liver wind. The so-called Yang Ming dryness generates wind changes. Chen Pingbo said "When the fire moves the wind generates wind when the wind is fanned the fire becomes fiery. When the governor\'s meridians are channeled outside they become spasms and when they are channeled up in the brain they faint." Or if the qi component cannot be fully resolved it will inevitably sink into human blood. Ye Tianshi said "The heat and evil of the qi component have not gone and gradually pass on to human blood components " and there are two Pan Qi and blood syndromes. The above are all changes in evil reality. The dryness and heat in the upper and middle regions inevitably consume the lung and stomach fluids causing damage to the vital energy. Therefore there is a transformation of excess evil and deficiency. Xu Huixi said "The extreme heat leads to the withering of the body fluids " and Yu Jiayan also said "Like a fire setting fire to a prairie the body fluids flow inside." Wu Kun\'an said "Warming evil damages the lung and stomach fluids and the body fluids in the stomach dry up. Even more so as Wu Jutong once said "Yin liquid and energy are both injured." This shows that the lung and stomach are dry and hot causing the first injury to the fluid and qi consuming the gas and liquid and ultimately damaging the qi and yin. This is a transformation from solid to deficiency. Urgent symptoms can lead to closure and detachment while slow symptoms can lead to persistent illnesses such as choking and thirst. The principle of treatment is to remove heat and save the fluid in the lungs and stomach by steaming and cauterizing the lung stomach and stomach fluids. Therefore the first step is to remove heat and save the fluid that is to urgently clear and eliminate the dry heat in the lungs and stomach and to save the body fluid in the lungs and stomach as the main task. The ancient people had a saying that "if you save a portion of the body fluid you will get a portion of the evil heat."

Both are symptoms of the exchange of qi and heat and the new sensation of heat and heat is caused by the mouth and nose with the lungs receiving the evil first and the stomach and intestines passing through it in the right direction ultimately resulting in the accumulation of qi. If the internal transmission of the human camp is superior to the heart it is called a reverse transmission therefore it is called a bad certificate. However due to the scorching heat in the summer the external collapse of the camp and the transformation of the qi are transmitted in a clockwise manner and cannot be called a bad symptom. It is always a heart and lung disease. The lung governs qi while the heart governs blood which belongs to the qi camp. The beginning lies in the qi camp and the end can consume the injured camp fluid. If delayed and untreated the internal closure of the dry fire can lead to syncope and detachment. Heart and lung dryness heat syndrome where dryness heat accumulates in the heart and lungs and those with mild pathogenic factors and shallow diseases tend to disturb the qi distribution either by clearing the channels through the upper trunk or by disturbing the heart and mind internally; Those with severe pathogenic diseases tend to be more intense than those with severe symptoms. At the beginning it will be steamed and burned in the qi camp but after a long time it will burn the camp fluid. In severe cases it will undergo internal closure and external detachment. The main pathogenesis of the heart lung dryness heat syndrome is heat burning qi camp so its treatment principle is always based on clearing and breathable camp: clearing and moistening lung dryness cooling and penetrating heart camp.

However the dryness and heat in the heart and stomach will burn in the qi and blood syndrome which is the opposite of the pathogenesis. It is commonly seen in febrile diseases heatstroke diseases or seasonal toxins warm toxins and plagues. When it is untreated and mistreated it transforms into heat and dryness. If the internal dryness and heat the spots and external penetration and it can be expected to be resolved by converting from blood to qi it is considered a syndrome. If it is not allowed to penetrate externally it will be deeply embedded in the blood vessels and become internal or latent spots which is a retrograde syndrome and often leads to irreparable consequences. Like the evil of dryness and heat deeply trapped in the blood of the camp steaming and burning within the camp not allowed to reach outside will inevitably penetrate the pericardium block the mind and stand at the risk of being dizzy and closed; When the heat is hot the wind moves and the liver wind is most likely to suddenly move leading to convulsions and convulsions; Evil thrives in internal closure the positive qi does not branch the internal orifices are blocked the positive qi stands detached and when the internal closure and external detachment occur it is difficult to handle them. Therefore it is important to be urgent and clear before burning and ensure that the evil of nourishing blood is transferred out of the Qi component in order to hope for external penetration and release. He Lianchen said "When using Qingying to penetrate the meridians the detoxification and detoxification of the spots are still not transparent. Often when attacking and expelling the poison the Qi of the mansion becomes clear and the spots begin to penetrate."

The new feeling of warmth and heat evil cannot be fully resolved in the Qi fraction and can sink into the human camp. In some cases the upper stem cells can close the heart and if the temperature is too hot the Ying fraction can collapse out of the Qi fraction. Although it is a good omen it can still be caused by the Ying human blood and transmitted back to the heart which is also a bad syndrome. If not treated properly there is a risk of internal closure and external detachment. The syndrome of dryness and heat in the heart is the evil of warming and heat which transforms heat into dryness and cannot be fully resolved through the separation of qi. It is a syndrome of invading the human body and entering the blood. Regardless of whether the new sensation of warmth and heat comes from the Qi Ren camp or the Fu temperature and heat come from the camp the evil of the camp points always passes through the Qi points which is a good omen; If the division of blood cannot be understood it becomes deeply immersed in human blood and becomes a mixture of blood and blood. Even if the division of blood is direct it can burn the blood causing the pathogenesis to be reversed. Although the warm and hot family has not openly spread the word against it the evil is deeply rooted in the disease and ultimately it is not a good situation. The syndrome of dryness and heat in the heart is a syndrome of deep stagnation of dryness and heat in the blood and blood of the camp. Therefore its treatment principle must be to transform the evil of the camp into the flow of qi and divide it into the flow while the flow of human blood is the main flow; It is advisable to clear away the heat of the camp and quickly release the qi. It is not advisable to force one\'s blood as Zhong Jing once said: "Once one goes against the sun then against the life cycle " which means one should not make mistakes again. Ye Tianshi clearly said "Entering a camp can still heat up and turn into qi and entering blood must cool down and dissipate blood." He Lianchen said "When penetrating a camp to release heat it can still be resolved by turning into qi."

The lung governs qi the liver governs blood and newly diagnosed diseases are caused by the division of qi in the lung and blood in the liver; The disease of heat stroke caused by excessive temperature is caused by the breakdown of blood in the liver which must be transmitted to the lung and stomach qi for resolution. It is due to the dryness and heat of the liver and lungs which transfers from the blood component to the qi component which is a normal external manifestation and a favorable symptom. If it is not externally transmitted and accumulates blood for a long time it will deeply burn the blood and even consume yin blood ultimately leading to the elimination of burning yin fluid. The disease will worsen and the kidney will turn to lower jiao resulting in a change of yin exhaustion and yang excess which should be considered an adverse syndrome. The syndrome of liver and lung dryness and heat where the blood is divided into dryness and heat must be steamed and burned. Therefore its treatment should mainly focus on clearing and cooling the blood quickly causing the blood to be divided into dryness and heat penetrating and reaching the dryness and heat of the blood and then releasing the qi and resolving it. This is called the method of transferring heat to qi. If the blood is divided into dryness and heat it falls in love with the blood and dissipates and burns the blood it will cause blood stasis and the heat will not reach the outside. Wang Qingren once said "The plague is within and the blood is burned and refined and the blood will coagulate." Therefore Ye Tianshi once said "Human blood is still afraid of consuming blood and activating it but it must be cooled and dissipated. If the dryness and heat of the blood component deeply sink into the yin component and dissipate the burning of the yin fluid then cooling the blood should be combined with nourishing the yin fluid to support it ensuring that the dryness and heat of the blood component are not transmitted downwards in order to avoid damaging the lower jiao true yin and causing success or failure.',tongueConditionList:["maroon color of the tongue","Tongue moist without moss and dirt","Moss yellow tongue red crimson","The tongue is crimson without fur","Tongue bright red without moss","Lingual redness"],pulseConditionList:["Soft or stringy pulse","Or micro number","The number of veins is infinite","Pulse string slip number","Pulse sinking decimal","Very cold limbs and pulse depression"]},{id:71,name:"Syndrome of kidney and stomach dryness and heat",alias:["Heat injured gas and liquid","More than Yangming","Deficiency of Shaoyin","Yin fluid depletion","Yin exhaustion and yang collapse","Internal hot rib",""],symptoms:["Blush on the face","Not cold but hot","Restless and sweatless","Excessive thirst and drinking","dipsosis","Red lips and wrinkled hair","Mouth erosion and air pollution","Gingival decay","Pharyngeal dryness with slight pain","polyphagia","Fast digestion with rapid hunger","The neck is densely covered in white","Color floating in the air without roots","Skin wasting","Red lips and wrinkled hair","Dry Mouth Siyin","Restless and sweatless","Five Hearts Burn","Eye stem","Red stool knot","Tidal fever","Pouget","Heat exhaustion in the morning","Afternoon heat rise","Five Hearts Burn","Frequent urination","Sleeping restlessly at night","gingival hemorrhage","Dissipating muscles","Hu'er Lei","Rough skin","Dry tongue scorched lips and dry teeth","Lumbar epidemic and leg weakness","diuresis","Tired all day long","Na Shao Xi Lie","Skin wasting","Qi timidity and profuse sweating","Tip of tongue tremor"],description:'The syndrome of irritable heat in the kidney and stomach is characterized by excessive heat and dryness in the upper and middle regions penetrating into the lower regions of the body. It is characterized by the deep division of qi and yin in the upper and lower regions of the body. The upper and lung fluids the middle and stomach fluids and the lower regions of the kidney yin are all burned by it resulting in a mixture of deficiency and excess. Jing Yue referred to it as "excess heat in the yang ming region and insufficient yin in the lower regions." This means that there is excess heat and dryness in the yang ming region and insufficient kidney water in the lower regions of the yin region. Therefore Wu Kun\'an also referred to it as "yang excess yin exhaustion" which means excessive heat and dryness in the stomach while the yin fluid in the kidney is. Slightly shallow cases may still be scorched with dry heat in the air and liquid while the pathogenic heat in the stomach may still be hyperactive and the yin fluid in the kidneys may gradually be damaged; The deep ones burn up the yin fluid the stomach heat is still hyperactive and the kidney yin is injured which is what Wu Kun\'an said: "It is the exhaustion of yang hyperactivity and yin and both the stomach juice and kidney fluid are dry." Moreover as Wu said "The body fluid in the stomach is dry and the kidney water in Shaoyin is not branched." This leads to a syndrome of yin fluid depletion. If further treatment is inappropriate there is a risk of Yin exhaustion and Yang excess. Therefore the Wu family has a saying that "if gastric juice is exhausted one must die and if kidney fluid is dried up it cannot be cured". Kidney stomach dryness heat syndrome is a syndrome of excess dryness heat in the stomach and insufficient yin fluid in the kidney. Therefore its treatment should damage its excess and supplement its deficiency. Gastric dryness and hyperactivity should be mainly focused on clearing away dampness and heat in order to preserve fluid and save yin; If the kidney yin dries up it should mainly nourish the kidney water.

The kidney is a water organ the kidney governs water and the lung is the source above water. When the source of water dries up the water spring will gradually shrink. Therefore the syndrome of lung kidney deficiency and dryness is often caused by a lack of body fluid in the lungs after a heat disease leading to the gradual formation and disappearance of kidney water while the deficiency and dryness of the lungs and kidneys arise internally. Some people also suffer from kidney yin deficiency or even more carelessly drink and turn pale. They do not sleep at night consume kidney yin and cannot contain pure gold. At the same time dragon fire ignites causing damage to lung yin and causing dryness of the lungs and kidneys. The former is caused by external factors and is easy to recover; The latter disease is caused by internal injury with damage to the true element and the most difficult to treat. Like the combination of internal and external evil the root has withered and is most easily exhausted. Wu Kun\'an said "It\'s due to the exhaustion of true water and water does not make fire."

It is caused by dry firewood and intense fire which does not cause self immolation." The syndrome of lung and kidney deficiency and dryness starts after an external disease and the disease is still shallow only the change of gas and liquid injuries; If it is deep it will consume the kidney yin and there will be the risk of yin fluid drying up.

The spleen regulates blood and the liver stores blood both of which are the main organs of blood. If there is insufficient blood it cannot nourish the liver and spleen causing them to dry up leading to deficiency and dryness. It is commonly seen in people who have lost too much blood or who have been overworked contemplating or depressed excessively accumulating fatigue and depression causing yin and blood damage gradually forming a withered face. The disease belongs to internal injury and treatment is not easy. The syndrome of liver and spleen deficiency and dryness always arises from blood deficiency. Blood deficiency generates internal heat which will consume yin fluid for a long time. Therefore in the beginning internal heat evaporates and burns the blood. If it does not dissolve it consumes yin fluid and yin blood is insufficient. The external cannot nourish the muscles and meridians resulting in muscle weakness. The internal cannot lubricate the large intestine resulting in wind constipation. Even if the liver loses nourishment withered trees generate wind and the wind and yang move inward the symptoms will pile up. The wind and yang will affect the meridians and if it is urgent it can cause spasms and convulsions. If it is slow it will cause damage to the door. The syndrome of liver and spleen deficiency and dryness is caused by insufficient yin blood to moisten the liver and spleen. Therefore its treatment principle is to mainly nourish yin blood with a large dose to moisten its dryness; If yin and blood are full then deficiency and dryness can be resolved internal heat can be eliminated and wind and yang can self extinguish; When the muscles and meridians are nourished they are relaxed while when the gastrointestinal tract is nourished it is transmitted smoothly.

Due to the fact that the liver is responsible for storing blood while the kidney is responsible for storing essence blood depletion is insufficient to nourish the liver leading to liver dryness; If the kidney essence is depleted and fundamentally shaken and the kidney water cannot match yang then the kidney dryness will arise internally. Or after a prolonged illness caused by heat heat damages yin and blood and fire burns yin and withers it; Or if a woman gives birth or has too many children excessive bleeding can cause damage to yin and blood; Or if the essence and blood of the elderly are insufficient and the origin has withered it can lead to the transformation of lower energizer deficiency and dryness. If it is mild it cannot nourish the muscles and meridians causing them to lose their nourishment; Unable to nourish the large intestine internally resulting in poor transmission; If the blood is heavy it will not nourish the liver but the liver will be dry and the kidney water will be sucked down; Or if the yin essence is insufficient to nourish the kidneys and the kidneys are dry and cannot nourish the liver and wood it can cause acute symptoms such as wood withering and wind generating. If the wind and yang move inward there may be spasms and convulsions; Slow down leads to yin withering and internal heat dissipating blood and the appearance of dragons rising internally which poses a risk of fatigue for pedestrians. Therefore the underlying dryness is fundamental and the pathogenesis is profound which is comparable to the upper dryness and the middle dryness. The syndrome of liver and kidney deficiency and dryness is characterized by insufficient essence and blood in the lower jiao of the disease.

For those with blood deficiency and fluid dryness it is advisable to nourish blood to moisten its dryness; For those who suffer from deficiency of essence and yin depletion it is advisable to nourish and fill in yin essence to aid them. He Lianchen said "Blood deficiency and fluid dryness are suitable for nourishing blood and moistening dryness." Yu Genchu also said "If the lower energizer is yin deficient then the essence and blood are dry but if the water is strong then the Jing Wei River flows freely.

It may first feel dampness or the dampness of diet which first accumulates in the spleen and then in the lungs. It can also lead to the syndrome of lung dryness and spleen dampness. Dryness is a yang evil while dampness belongs to the yin category. Dryness evil will damage and consume yin fluid while dampness evil often stagnates yang qi. Therefore if dryness is heavy it will dissipate qi and liquid while if dampness is heavy it will stagnate jin qi for a long time and then dampness evil will transform into heat; Exhaustion of dampness will naturally transform dryness so the lung and spleen dampness syndrome will ultimately damage residual qi and fluid. However the coexistence of dryness and dampness is the most difficult to decompose so there are also mixed syndromes of dryness damaging yin fluid and dampness damaging yang qi in the later stage. The syndrome of lung and spleen dryness and dampness is characterized by lung dryness and spleen dampness. Nourishing lung dryness leads to stagnation of spleen dampness dryness benefits spleen dampness and also consumes fluids to aid dryness. Therefore its treatment principle is to moisten dryness moderately without hindering dryness or helping dampness as Yu Genchu once said: "Xin Runli Lun is suitable for ascending Shang Jiao is suitable and Qi Qi dampness is opened. The method of gently promoting and transforming qi is the most stable when used in the initial stage.

It is a syndrome of external dampness and internal dryness as well as excess dampness and deficiency dryness. Or it may be due to the deficiency of kidney yin water deficiency and fire hyperactivity and the exhaustion of yin leading to dryness; Or warm and deep heat can cause the person to lower the heat depleting the yin fluid of the kidney leading to kidney dryness. And if the spleen dampness is heavy or if the spleen dampness flows down dampness and heat damage yin and the spleen dampness is not already present the kidney dryness will return which can become the spleen kidney dryness syndrome of spleen dampness and kidney dryness.

Internal injuries are often caused by alcohol dampness damaging the spleen and lust damaging the kidney. External injuries are already difficult to treat." It is a disease in which the dampness evil always stagnates in the qi of the spleen and kidney while dryness evil can be divided into shallow and deep ones. Shallow ones only consume gas and liquid while deep ones will inevitably damage yin fluid and blood. Spleen and kidney dampness syndrome: Spleen dampness should be considered as dryness while kidney dryness should be considered as nourishment. Initially dryness and dampness complement each other with a mixture of deficiency and excess. Therefore nourishing kidney dryness and dryness spleen dampness can be combined simultaneously. If it lasts for a long time it will damage the kidney yin and spleen blood. Therefore it is necessary to nourish yin and nourish blood to alleviate its dryness and also use sweet light penetrating and beneficial methods to eliminate its dampness and stagnation; Always follow the principle of moderate dryness and appropriate tonifying.',tongueConditionList:["Tongue light fat and fur white","Tongue bright red Shaojin"],pulseConditionList:["Weak pulse sinking"]},{id:80,name:"Syndrome of wind fire in lung and stomach",alias:["Wind and fire","Wind and fire are choking up","Wind temperature fire","Gastric hot spot","Fenghuo Renluo","Fire poison internal attack","Hot and windy",""],symptoms:["slight chills","Seasonal sensation of cold and heat","Fever and chills","Joint soreness","No sweat on the body","disturbed hidrosis","Pustular ulcer causing swelling around the body","Fever and high fever","Dry mouth and desire to drink","Dry tongue and dry lips","Thirst","abdominal distension and fullness","Constipation","Hematuria","headache","Distending headache","Headache and convulsions","Painful bloating","Seeing the wind and becoming more dramatic","Blurred vision","with one's head in swim","hoarse voice","angina","Sore throat and swollen throat","Throat pain and anorexia","stuffy nose","Nosebleed","burbid nasal discharge","Salivary discharge with blood","bloodshot eyes","Metatarsal swelling","Parotid gland swelling and pain","Anterior and posterior ear swelling","Head and face redness swelling and pain","heavy eyes","fullness of the chest and epigastrium","Coughing and spitting","Chest tightness and shortness of breath","Sticky saliva covered in cloth"],description:'The Lung Stomach Wind Fire Syndrome is a fundamental disease of external wind carrying internal fire.

If there is no solution to the division of qi and blood there may also be gradual changes in the division of qi and blood resulting in a transformation of the intersection of qi and blood. This is what Xie Shi said: "Yang Ming blood heat evil from the internal transmission has already spread throughout the three jiao." If the treatment is delayed and lost wind and fire carry phlegm blinding the upper jiao blocking the clearing of the orifices there is a risk of spasms and convulsions. As Zhang Zhongjing said: "Wind warming is a disease and the dramatic appearance is like a sudden seizure. The lung stomach wind fire syndrome is characterized by wind stagnation on the outside fire burning on the inside and stagnation on the upper middle and clear qi. Therefore the principle of its treatment should always be based on clearing and dispersing. Lei Shaoyi said "Smooth the lungs and clear the stomach." Wu Kun\'an said "Qi that is not properly wind-heat can dry in the upper jiao and it should be treated by dispersing evil and clearing heat. It should not be blindly cold and cool." "It must be mainly spicy and scattered and cold and cool should not be suddenly used to suppress evil. As the saying goes "Evil lies in the emptiness and emptiness of the upper energizer. It is not a medicine that directly reaches the stomach due to bitter cold but can be treated. If the disease cannot be resolved there will be a change of faintness and spasms. Shao Xiangen also said "The evil is in the upper energizer and the medicine should be light and clear and then taken slowly. Yu Genchu also said "Avoid sudden use of bitter cold and prohibit waves from using spicy heat. It is advisable to disperse wind evil and clear the hidden fire as Xie Yinglu once said: "Thoroughly eliminate the evil from both inside and outside making the surface and inside clear and the mind clear.

It is composed of the spleen and stomach in the central region and is known to accumulate heat to transform fire. Occasionally it is restrained by external wind and erupts due to depression. This is what Ma Yuanyi called "the syndrome of evil wind fanning outwards solid fire burning inwards and external and internal evil knots". Xie Yinglu called it "the true wind fire syndrome where wind rides the fire momentum and fire borrows the wind power". Its occurrence is also violent so its onset is often urgent severe and dangerous. In light cases it can disturb the clear and empty space of the upper body while in severe cases it can block the meridians and channels preventing smooth passage through the limbs; Even stirring phlegm and fire blocking all orifices. As Xu Lingtai called it "phlegm and fire are abundant and all the orifices are closed." At this time the wind and fire are in full bloom and the normal qi is not supported. Once the internal orifices are closed the vitality is detached and there is a danger of fainting. Therefore in mild cases it can cause headaches and headaches while in severe cases it can cause stroke and syncope. The spleen stomach wind fire syndrome is caused by the external wind triggering the stagnation fire in the middle energizer where the wind is bound externally and the fire originates from the spleen. Therefore its treatment principle is to dissipate wind depression externally dampen the fiery power internally and release both the exterior and interior so that the wind is calm and the fire is calm which can alleviate its urgency; The first priority is to disperse the wind. Zhang Zhongjing said "Although the fire is weak the internal attack is powerful and the bones and tendons are scorched making it difficult to recover the blood." However he still believes that "the floating pulse should be resolved through sweat And Xie Yinglu also said "If you want to relieve yourself you must first be troubled. If you are troubled you will be relieved by sweat. How can you know it? If your pulse is floating you will know that sweat will be relieved." Xie Yinglu also said "If you attack your sweat you can reach the limit of evil. The natural wind and fire are calm and flat which is in line with the meaning of the stagnation of fire." He also said "Wind and fire are intertwined and the situation is extremely fierce and urgent. You should use licorice to slow down the fire. He Lianchen also advocated "dispersing the wind to relieve heat." This is a method of relieving bitterness and is indispensable. Therefore Ma Yuanyi advocated "dividing and dissipating the upper and lower parts treating the surface and inner parts and using warmth to nourish the attack so that the sweat does not harm the past and the lower part does not harm the severe.',tongueConditionList:[],pulseConditionList:["Pulse inch string","Two levels of prosperity come to an end","thready and rapid pulse"]},{id:82,name:"Syndrome of wind fire in gallbladder and stomach",alias:["Shaoyang Wood Fire",""],symptoms:["Aversion to cold without sweat","Body pain","Backache","Eyes red and mouth bitter","Two Ear Wheel Yellow","Pain from building in the ear","Australian hot loose stools","Drowning short and red astringent","headache","Red swelling and pain in the ear","My cheeks are also red swollen and painful","The ear sounds like cicada noise","Full of annoyance","Always nauseous","abdominal fullness","distending pain in the lower abdomen"],description:'The gallbladder stomach wind fire syndrome is a syndrome of external wind carrying internal fire which is caused by wind heat sinking in carrying wood fire in the gallbladder causing depression and outbreak. Its onset is urgent and severe mostly caused by carrying warm and toxic substances and is known to be a syndrome of external depression and internal fire. Gallbladder is Shaoyang "said Wu Kun\'an." Covering Shaoyang is originally a form of phase fire warming evil and phase fire and using the same qi and phase movements. Shaoyang uses wood fire as its purpose warming evil within and must use Shaoyang as its outlet. "It is also said that" covering Shaoyang belongs to wood fire and the meridians in the wind are also affected by qi causing wind induced fire inflammation. Therefore its onset is often acute and severe. Those who carry warmth with the wind will only suppress the clear qi of the upper jiao while those who carry cold with the wind will inevitably suppress the clear yang of the upper jiao; When the external wind dissipates and the internal heat turns to redness it must enter the blood from qi which is a sign of the exchange of qi and blood. The gallbladder stomach wind fire syndrome is a syndrome of external wind heat warming evil accompanied by Shaoyang wood fire and characterized by external stagnation and internal redness. Therefore the principle of its treatment is always to induce wind and heat from the outside and to lower wood fire from the inside as the method. Therefore Wu Kun\'an once said "These are all gallbladder fire that is abundant in the inside and when it goes up through the empty body it is natural not limited to the excess syndrome of typhoid and cold but treated with Shaoyang and fire. It is also known as: "The evil of wood fire should be treated from Shaoyang." Zhong Jing had the warning of the three unworkable methods: "Shaoyang should not sweat sweating leads to delirium."

More often due to external wind and heat the disease is lost and transformed into fire; Either there is accumulation of heat in the stomach or the liver fire wind and yang are abundant in the stomach and external heat is carried by internal heat resulting in a combination of internal and external pathogenic factors. The two fires are intertwined causing the disease to become urgent and severe. Sometimes it goes against the empty orifice or the internal heat is ignited in the Tianjin Qi. In severe cases the wind and fire are intertwined and there is a change of wind movement and convulsion; Those who have a slow state may experience stagnation of blood due to human blood or depletion of yin fluid due to human yin which often leads to stubborn and chronic diseases.

It is a syndrome of internal wind fire or due to external wind heat wind dryness dryness and heat in the human body or due to excessive emotions it excites the liver and gallbladder wood fire and external evil knows to follow the fire to assist the liver yang. The liver yang is hyperactive and the hyperactivity of the liver yang also originates from the fire and the fire is strong enough to generate wind resulting in the syndrome of wind fire. It is also a syndrome of head wind nose and meridians which is caused by the examination of the empty orifices. It is called the syndrome of wind yang and meridians Pu Fuzhou said "The body\'s liver and gallbladder are extremely hot and they are also affected by wind evil which cannot be resolved due to stagnation." This is based on the hyperactivity of the body\'s liver yang and gallbladder fire and the external wind dryness transforms into fire. As Yu Genchu once said "The wind poison has been lingering for a long time and it is often turned into fire." Wu Jutong also said "Dryness transforms into fire." Zhang Qianli said "The dry fire shines on the lungs but gold does not make wood. The liver yang transforms into wind and the upper disturbance clears the air. Therefore although it is called internal cause it is also related to external evil. Its reason is different from that of wind yang which is characterized by hyperactivity and is often related to external evil. Therefore its treatment principle does not lie in suppressing latent energy but should be based on clearing and lowering not on extinguishing the wind but rather on lightly promoting and clearing which is different from the wind yang syndrome. Therefore Yu Genchu once said "Light and clear propaganda leads to the most achievements" and Pu Fuzhou also advocated the method of "clearing the liver and gallbladder dispelling wind and evil".',tongueConditionList:["fklushed tongue","yelow coating of the tongue","Sharp red and prickly tongue edges","Thin moss"],pulseConditionList:["The pulse string is tight and powerful","Sinking is particularly severe","String disease","wire and frequent pulse","Pulse string strength","Strong pulse count","Smooth and solid pulse"]},{id:85,name:"Syndrome of wind fire in heart and gall",alias:["Shaoyang febrile disease","The wood fire is blazing","Qi Ying Two Incandescence","Danhuo Incense Camp","Ying fen blood fever",""],symptoms:["Heat excess","Hot flashes are mild and heavy every day","Thirst","extrdeme thirst","Sweating and movement all release tongue symptoms","Yellow in moss","Night heat reignites","Heat is greater than night","Red cheeks","Chest rash","Suitable for menstruation","Inducing thirst and drinking","Small frequency","Obstruction of defecation","Vexation","Sometimes I feel drowsy and drowsy","Sometimes language errors occur","coma and delirium","be bereft of reason","Sleeping injury with limb cramps","Qi makes a gurgling sound","Belching discomfort"],description:'The Heart Gallbladder Wind Fire Syndrome is a type of wind fire syndrome where the fire is strong and the wind is strong. The wind is generated from the inside not from the outside. It is mostly driven by the warm and hot qi that is deeply trapped in the blood of the camp carrying the wood fire in the gallbladder. The normal fire and evil fire are intertwined and the fire is strong and the wind is generated. The disease is in the blood of the camp. Therefore it is known as the camp dividing blood and heat and the gallbladder fire is hot and the camp which is what Wu Kun\'an said: "This warm evil is trapped in Shaoyin and it occurs on the surface of Shaoyang." It is called Shaoyang Warm Disease and the hand Shaoyin heart is the main blood of the camp which is the same disease as the heart and gallbladder. The Wu family referred to it as\' the gallbladder is hot and the camp is divided into heat and the syndrome is not light and insignificant \'. The pathogenesis of this disease is mild where the heat source reaches the qi component and is caused by the co burning of qi and blood. In severe cases the heat source sinks into the blood component resulting in two types of heat sources: the heat source and the blood source; If the heat burns for a long time it will inevitably consume the yin fluid of the injured camp resulting in a syndrome of deficiency burning. The syndrome of wind and fire in the heart and gallbladder is a syndrome of the heart camp subduing fire and the wood fire in the gallbladder coexisting. Therefore its treatment principle should always be to clear the camp and cool the blood promote heat and promote fluid production and clear and lower the wood fire as the method in order to relieve the internal burning of the wood fire Wu Kun\'an said "Clearing the heat of the gallbladder and the internal organs as well as relieving the pathogenic factors of the camp and division the heat toxin self resolves." Increasing fluid and generating fluid to protect its yin is also important. Wu once said "Nourishing the water of Shaoyin and the fire of Shaoyang self resolves." This is the method of increasing fluid and saving burning. Although it is called wind and fire it cannot be evacuated with wind medicine to consume and aid fire.

It is caused by the direct entry of heat evil into the heart liver blood system transforming the fire into the internal heat triggering the liver wind. Wind and fire fan each other and dangerous situations emerge repeatedly making treatment extremely difficult. Cheng Xingxuan said "The evil of warming heat and wind heat deeply affects the blood system either immediately or not and accumulates in the heart and liver often causing spasms and convulsions. Therefore there are diseases such as heatstroke heatstroke wind heatstroke seizures heatstroke convulsions spasms caused by central organs and erysipelas. Warm heat and other heat pathogens directly attack the heart liver and blood components and are in harmony with the fire of the monarch\'s phase. The evil fire and the normal fire are intertwined and the strong fire generates wind causing internal movement of the liver wind. Fire takes advantage of the wind and the wind helps the fire to be powerful and the wind and fire are intertwined. Therefore the disease often erupts and becomes severe. If it can reach the Qi component on its own its symptoms are slightly mild; If one cannot achieve self realization and falls into the heart the symptoms are severe and treatment is also difficult. Every time the body is closed and the wind moves the wood fire burns and cannot be saved. Therefore Cheng Xingxuan sighed that "evil has entered the internal organs and it is difficult to expel it". Heart liver wind fire syndrome is a syndrome of excessive fire generating wind. To treat its wind it is necessary to first treat its fire. Therefore its treatment principle should mainly focus on cooling and clearing blood ensuring the accumulation of the fire of the heart liver blood fraction and quickly converting the Qi fraction to relieve it; If the condition is close to the surface it is advisable to have a slight reference and penetrate it thoroughly so that it can be resolved from the skin ulcers; For those close to the gastrointestinal tract slightly attack and defecate. For those with closed orifices and internal combustion they should follow Wu Jutong\'s "method of clearing heat and opening the orifices clearing the camp and benefiting yin cooling the liver and extinguishing the wind." Wu Kun\'an said "This evil has already passed through the camp and reached the blood fraction. The heart governs the blood and the evil dries the blood fraction gradually becoming closed internally. The wind medicine dries the blood and the body should be restrained greatly.

Mild external cold can only suppress Wei Qi while severe external cold can block Wei Yang; If the fire is mild it will steam and burn the blood while if the fire is heavy it will be hot and burn the blood; If the external cold cannot be resolved the latent fire cannot reach the outside which will cause internal channeling block the mind and even trigger the liver wind resulting in a closed syndrome of wind induced spasms and convulsions. Heart lung cold fire syndrome is a syndrome of external cold stagnation and internal fire candle burning. The external cold cannot be resolved and the internal fire cannot penetrate. Therefore the principle of its treatment should be based on relieving external heat and dispersing cold and external heat should have a path of external penetration; However if the fire is hot inside it will consume the body fluid.

Or by experiencing new sensations of heat warmth and dampness the heat directly affects the lung and stomach qi; Alternatively due to heat stroke and dampness and temperature collapse in the upper middle and second jiao it can become a lung stomach dampness fire syndrome. The stomach is the meridian of foot yang ming so the warm heat family is also commonly referred to as yang ming syndrome. The pathogenesis of this disease is dampness suppressed outside and fiery inside also known as dampness heat accumulation which can be seen in various diseases such as heat stroke heat stroke heat stroke and dampness temperature. The lung stomach dampness fire syndrome although its pathogenesis is dampness suppressed outside and fire blazing inside but in cases where dampness is still severe it often accumulates in the upper jiao stagnating and clearing qi As Zhang Yuqing once said "Striving to establish the Yang Ming syndrome the Qi mechanism is blocked." Jin Zijiu once said "Flowing through the Qi points spreading the Three Jiao." Those with a heavier fire tend to dissipate the burning fluid in the body which is mostly in the middle of the Jiao stomach. This is the so-called Yang Ming syndrome as He Lianchen once said "Dampness is exhausted and dryness is dissipated and heat is scorching Yang Ming . If the qi is not resolved or if it is delayed and untreated it can also penetrate deep into the blood resulting in a state of qi and blood intermingling or if it is held for a long time it can consume qi and qi and there may also be changes in evil excess and deficiency. Lung and stomach dampness and fire syndrome the disease is related to the middle and second jiao. Therefore the main principle of treatment is to clear and purify the lungs and stomach as Ye Tianshi once said: "Clearing the upper middle is essential. He Lianchen also said "Covering the syndrome of dampness and heat clearing the lungs and stomach like a scorching heat steaming a cool wind suddenly rises and the dampness and heat subside in an instant like ascending to the realm of coolness.

The dampness and fire in the stomach the downward movement of the large intestine and the struggle with the dross in the intestines resulting in a dryness syndrome caused by the exhaustion of dampness and fluid injury. The disease is formed by the transformation of dampness and heat into fire and the transformation of dampness and heat into dryness. Therefore it is also common in the middle and late stages of diseases such as dampness and heat heat dampness and dampness and summer heat. The onset of the disease is in the Qi component which cannot be resolved and the dampness and fire sink in. The injured blood can also be converted into the human blood component resulting in a syndrome of Qi and blood intermingling. The gastrointestinal organs are solid and the. However although the dryness has subsided the air and liquid have been injured and the remaining evil remains. There are often symptoms of deficiency and stagnation. If the current situation is lost the evil fire cannot be released either it goes up and becomes a reversal or it is forced down and becomes a catharsis benefit; Even if the deity is shut down internally and the yang qi is shut down externally there will be a change of closed syncope. If the dampness and fire do not go away the positive qi will be injured and the evil will prevail over the positive deficiency. There are also many closed deficiencies and even there is a danger of closed detachment. Gastrointestinal dampness and fire syndrome is a type of dryness and stagnation syndrome caused by dampness and fire in the stomach descending into the intestines and competing with the dross in the intestines. Therefore the treatment principle should always be to clear and lower the dryness in the intestines in order to drive away dampness and fire However Xue Shengbai said "Due to the sticky dampness and heat it is advisable to slow down the internal accumulation. Unlike the dampness and evil heat in typhoid fever the dry accumulation is solid and the lower accumulation should be steep." Ye Tianshi said "The evil accumulation of typhoid fever is sudden and the lower accumulation should be fierce. Warm diseases often involve dampness and evil internal pulsation and the lower accumulation should be mild. Feces of typhoid fever are loose and the evil accumulation cannot be eliminated. Feces of dampness and warm diseases are loose and the evil accumulation is not completed. The hard stool formula is without dampness and cannot be attacked."

By absorbing the evil of warming heat it runs straight through the middle path and accumulates between the original gallbladder and stomach carrying water and grain in the stomach and combining with wood fire in the gallbladder to transform fire into a concurrent syndrome. The stomach is the organ of Yang Ming while the gallbladder belongs to the organ of Shaoyang. Therefore hurting the Han family is also known as the disease of Shaoyang Yang Ming. The syndrome of dampness and fire in the gallbladder and stomach is characterized by the accumulation of pathogenic factors between the gallbladder and stomach. If the pathogenic factors originate from the stomach they will stagnate and suppress the qi of clearing yang in the upper and middle parts and then burn the qi of the stomach. If it does not resolve it will often move down the large intestine and attach to the dross in the intestine forming a syndrome of visceral excess. If the evil comes from the gallbladder it will suppress the mechanism of turning the pivot and carry the wood fire in the gallbladder to move. Either it will accumulate in the upper part of the gallbladder or it will ignite inside or it will persist in the upper part of the gallbladder. The syndrome of dampness and fire in the gallbladder and stomach is characterized by a disease located between the upper and middle parts and between the surface and the inner parts. Therefore its treatment principle should be based on the principle of dredging and clearing away the internal and external heat. Yu Genchu said "The method should be to relieve the external and internal heat through bitterness and bitterness. And it is said: "Xin Liang Wei San is used to relieve external heat and external evil is relieved through slight sweating; warming clearing and seeping causing dampness and heat to be relieved through urination." If the evil in the stomach is transmitted to the large intestine it attaches to the dross in the intestine and the Yu family once again advocates: "Bitter and bitter are relieved through defecation and dampness and heat are relieved through defecation Dampness is outside the gastrointestinal tract and heat is inside the gastrointestinal tract. The dampness heat and sliminess of the entrapment of evil energy compete with the dross in the intestines and steam it into a very sticky greasy and foul smelling sauce. It must wait until the entrapment of evil energy reaches five or six times or seven or eight times and then the entrapment of evil energy begins to dissipate.

It is caused by dampness and fire in the stomach which invades the liver internally. It triggers the wooden fire in the liver which rushes inward upwards and downwards. It is caused by the interaction of qi and blood evil fire and normal fire and even redness and yin fluid. Warm diseases are called Jueyin Warm Diseases where heat enters Jueyin or malaria of Jueyin or forces blood yin fluid to descend resulting in five color dysentery and silent dysentery. The liver stomach dampness and fire syndrome starts with stomach dampness and liver fire followed by dampness exhaustion and dryness and liver stomach intermingling. Therefore its treatment should always be combined with the stomach to release the liver and the same method as the stomach. It starts with dampness stagnation and the main method is to warm the stomach and dissipate dampness which is to soothe the stomach as Ye Tianshi said; The method of strengthening yang and clearing jue yin calming the stomach and relieving the liver. Wu Kun\'an said "It is advisable to relieve jue yin with a combination of yang and brightness bitter bitter sour cold and hot. If the liver and stomach are not effective it will lead to a void like a valley in the stomach and the Qi will go against the Qi causing it to rush upwards. It is necessary to calm and soothe the stomach." Over time the dampness will be exhausted and dry and the dampness will become a dry fire. It is also necessary to clear and lower the dryness to harmonize with the stomach as Xu Zhengkui once said: "The stomach is dry and hot the liver fire is inflamed and the gallbladder and stomach are lost.

It is a syndrome of dampness fire from the lungs to the heart from the qi to the yin from the yin to the blood and from the yin to the blood and from the evil fire to the yin. The syndrome is often acute and dangerous and is often caused by diseases such as dampness temperature summer heat and summer heat. Dampness gradually turns into fire without being released but instead subsides from the yin. Therefore there is a risk of internal closure and external detachment. Heart lung dampness and fire syndrome where dampness and fire are transmitted from the lungs to the heart and from the qi to the human body. Therefore its treatment principle should be urgent and clear so that the evil of qi division can reach the outside and be resolved without sinking into the human camp; If it has already sunk in both Qi and blood can still penetrate heat and transform Qi causing the evil of blood to penetrate and release Qi; Steaming and burning body fluids with damp fire boiling them into phlegm will inevitably be combined with resolving phlegm and promoting resuscitation to prevent internal closure; Evil fire will burn the lung fluid so ginseng should also be used to nourish the fluid to support its evil and prevent its detachment.

It is caused by the inability of dampness and fire in the stomach to resolve and the reverse transmission of dampness and fire in the heart. It is also a syndrome of dampness and fire in the stomach which is caused by the division of qi and heat in the stomach and cannot be fully resolved. It can also cause the collapse of dampness and heat in the human blood and in some cases it can be transmitted back to the pericardium. It is often caused by the failure to treat dampness and heat and the misdiagnosis of; This syndrome can also be seen in the case of infantile fetal toxicity turning into fire. Damp fire obstructing the pericardium also known as dampness obstructing can cause internal closure due to the incandescence of the heart. If the yang qi is not sufficient it can also be seen as jue inversion which belongs to the case of deep heat and jue and ultimately belongs to the syndrome of closed jue. The syndrome of dampness and fire in the heart and stomach is caused by the steaming of dampness and heat in the stomach. It first occurs in the Qi fraction and if it is not resolved it gradually enters the blood stream. Wu Kun\'an said "Any heat must carry dampness and dampness is the evil of heavy turbidity. Heat is the Qi of fumigation with heat in the middle of dampness and dampness in the middle and dampness and heat in the middle obstructing the Qi fraction. It should be treated in the Tai Yin of the hand. If it cannot be treated and the evil has no place to vent it gradually enters the Ying fraction and invades the blood stream. At the beginning it is a period of Qi Ying steaming and burning while at the end it is a period of human blood and it is a mixture of Qi and blood or a period of Qi Ying steaming and burning; Even if the heart and mind are closed internally it can lead to a severe syndrome of closed syncope as Wu Jutong once said: "The heat evil cannot be resolved and deep blood is divided into syncope." Eventually it will consume gastric juice and as Ye Tianshi said "The heat disturbance will consume gastric juice and damage blood vessels." The syndrome of dampness and fire in the heart and stomach is a syndrome of dampness and fire in the stomach where qi enters the camp and blood. Therefore the treatment principle is to urgently clear the Qi and blood or to clear the Qi and blood so that the evil of internal depression can be resolved by converting the Qi and blood from the blood to the Qi. However heat comes from dampness and heat is located in dampness. Therefore it should also be combined with fragrance and light to dissolve the uncleaned dampness and to open the veil of dampness and turbidity which is what Wu Kun\'an said: "It is advisable to release dampness to dissipate heat. If dampness and heat are combined to evaporate body fluid becomes phlegm and phlegm is turbid and obstructed it should also be used to clear phlegm and promote resuscitation; Fire burns the body fluid and it dries up so it should also be used to clear and nourish the body fluid in the stomach.

It is a syndrome of dampness and fire reverse transmission which is what Ye Tianshi called: passing through the Wei Ren Camp reverse transmission to the pericardium hence there are heatstroke Ren Camp heatstroke invagination heat stroke blood points heat closure of the heart and dampness and warmth multiplying the pericardium. It is also known as the heart being the hand Shaoyin and the pericardium being the hand Juyin hence it is also known as heatstroke induced Juyin heatstroke induced Jushao and so on. It is often caused by the transformation of heat evil into fire such as heat dampness heat heat and summer heat. If the heat is not treated properly it can lead to the loss of heat and dampness resulting in the wrong treatment of heat and dampness. The so-called "dampness exhaustion and irritability" also has this syndrome. The syndrome of dampness and fire in the heart is characterized by the evil of dampness and fire which cannot be fully resolved in the division of qi. It can sink into the human camp causing both qi and fire to evaporate in the beginning and burning the camp fluid in the long run. If it is not quickly and clear it will inevitably sink deeply into blood and become a syndrome of both qi and blood or camp blood. Dampness is fiery and body fluid condenses into phlegm. Therefore dampness and fire often carry phlegm and turbidity and fire spreads to the pericardium. Phlegm closes the internal orifices leading to internal closure and convulsions. If the evil is abundant and the qi is not supported there will be a change of internal closure and external detachment. The treatment of the syndrome of dampness and fire in the heart camp is always based on clearing the camp and permeating heat causing the evil of the internal camp to sink into the camp and then turning out the qi to dissolve so as not to sink into blood again; It also helps to dissipate phlegm and promote resuscitation in order to prevent convulsions and convulsions. Although fire comes from dampness its clarity should still be combined with the function of relieving dampness. As Wu Kun\'an once said "Heat is caused by dampness and evil so it is advisable to relieve dampness to dissipate heat; relieving dampness and heat and removing dampness will lead to the self release of heat.

It always belongs to the transformation of dampness and fire burning in the heart and liver qi and blood and is a concurrent disease of dampness and fire in the lung and stomach qi and dampness and fire in the heart and liver blood. It is often carried by a wooden fire and the hot wind moves. The wooden fire generates wind so it is also known as the heat wind. It is an internal wind rather than an external wind and is different from the heat wind that carries heat in the wind. The syndrome of dampness and fire in the heart and liver or the collapse of the heart and liver blood from the lung and stomach qi or the collapse of the heart and liver blood from the lung and stomach qi are both symptoms of both qi and blood redness. If the evil of the qi component is in the blood it cannot reach the qi component or if the evil of the blood component is in the blood it cannot reach the qi component and if the blood is burned the disease is particularly severe. If the wood fire of the liver is disturbed and interacts with the fire of the heart ruler it will lead to multiple wood fire changes and in the drama the heart and liver will be closed and there is a risk of convulsion. Heart liver dampness fire syndrome is a critical and urgent syndrome characterized by dampness fire burning in the heart liver blood. Therefore the treatment principle is to urgently cool the blood and release the fire to clear it and to ensure that the blood and fire are converted into qi and released. Xue Shengbairi said "When dampness is exhausted and fire is dissipated human blood flows and desires to be released. Blood or sweat is lost from up and down so it is necessary to cool the blood and release the fire to save yin." This is because bleeding is the way out for blood to divide and subdue the fire. Therefore it is not necessary to stop the astringency. If there is an urgent need to clear and release the fire the blood vessels will be at peace. Hua Ban Wai Da is also a way for the blood to accumulate fire and penetrate through the outside. It should follow Wu Kun\'an\'s principle of "clearing and dispersing blood to penetrate the spots and adding fragrance to dispel impurities to open and close" which also helps to suppress fire and penetrate through the outside.',tongueConditionList:["red or maroon tongue with yellowish coating","Moss root yellow and greasy","fklushed tongue","crimson tongue","red tongue with little coating"],pulseConditionList:["wire and frequent pulse","thready and rapid pulse","Pulse string count and acute illness","thready and rapid pulse"]},{id:100,name:"Syndrome of dampness fire of heart and kidney",alias:["Fire evil counter riding pericardium","Blood moisture and heat","shaoyin disease","Withered and blazing","flaring up of deficient fire","Disharmony between the heart and the kidney","Heart fire moves down the small intestine","Drowning human blood",""],symptoms:["Fever does not subside","A bitter taste","Deutzia short red fever","Less cold and more heat","Light day and heavy night","Eyes red and lips red","Lip and tongue redness and swelling","Dryness and cracking","dirty complexion","Anxiety and aversion to heat","Insomnia","Dry mouth does not like drinking","Chest and abdomen burning with heat","Sudden onset of menstrual flow due to non seasonal changes"],description:"The syndrome of dampness and fire in the heart and kidney is a change in the blood and yin fractions of people with deep dampness and fire. Damp fire is caused by the burning of qi and blood deep depression of yin and the rushing of yin fluid. It is deep and heavy from the upper jiao to the lower jiao and is often caused by the stagnation of heat dampness and heat resulting in internal depression. Therefore in ancient times it was referred to as the deficiency syndrome of Fu heatstroke due to its burning of yin and the inclusion of deficiency in the solid; Or it may develop into miscellaneous diseases such as drowning in toxic human blood drowning crimson gonorrhea red turbidity etc. It is always caused by the burning of yin blood with damp fire. The syndrome of dampness and fire in the heart and kidney is caused by the stagnation of qi dampness and fire which leads to the accumulation of human blood. However if it is transmitted to the heart there will be a phenomenon of qi and blood intermingling. If the division of blood is not resolved it will inevitably lead to a deep division of yin. Heart fire will descend to the kidneys and burn the kidney yin resulting in yin blood intermingling. Over time yin blood will be consumed causing kidney yin to be consumed yin fluid to be consumed kidney water to dry up and kidney fire will become excessively high disturbing the heart master and causing restlessness in the fire of the ruler. All of them are symptoms of deficiency in reality and burning yin injury. The syndrome of dampness and fire in the heart and kidney is characterized by the burning of dampness and fire at the blood yin point. Therefore the treatment principle should always be to urgently cool blood and relieve heat to protect its yin fluid.

The accumulation of dampness and heat from diet transforms into fire and the dampness of the spleen and stomach heat mutually evaporate and ignite each other. It can also be caused by feeling the evil of heat dampness and turbidity. Dampness accumulates in the spleen and heat evaporates in the stomach which is combined with the dampness and heat that stops inside and the stagnation of dampness and heat transforms into fire forming the syndrome of dampness and fire. Dampness suppresses fire which must be attributed to the stomach and even burns the large intestine. It often competes with the dross in the intestines forming a yang ming syndrome hence it is also known as yang ming and heat warming. Steaming with damp heat often leads to yellowing which is a disease of yang yellow. The dampness and heat of the spleen and stomach transform into dampness and fire syndrome often competing with the dross in the intestines to form a steaming trend. He Lianchen said "Sticky dampness and heat compete with tangible dross" gradually becoming the syndrome of "dampness and heat have already dissipated and heat accumulation exists alone" as Wu Jutong once said. Even when it is caused by anger and blood and the transaction is hot dampness and fire syndrome is more dangerous than dampness and heat. Wu Kun\'an once said "Evil heat is transmitted from Yangming to Taiyin and the deeper the heat the more severe the poison". It may carry phlegm and ascend to the clear orifices confuse the divine mechanism block the internal orifices and become a closed syndrome. However if the circulation is too low it can also damage the spleen and stomach qi and fluid. Every time there is too much it can cause detachment. Xie Yinglu said "If the external pressure is too high it can damage the spleen and stomach causing the middle soil to become tired causing the body fluid to sink and not rise. Otherwise the middle soil will become completely hopeless." In the spleen and stomach dampness fire syndrome dampness suppresses the fierceness and the treatment should be urgent to release dampness and release fire to subdue its potential. Ye Tianshi said "The three jiao are obstructed the turbid qi is diffuse the pungent fragrance drives away the impurities and the appropriate circulation is a certain method." However when the spleen and stomach are filled with fire they will fake the large intestine as the way out Wang Tingzhen once said "Dampness and heat in the stomach and internal organs can only be discussed. Although the cloud transforms heat it is mainly due to dampness that the diagnosis of warm diseases is necessary. When yellow dryness is seen it can be discussed. When yellow dryness is seen it can still be used to expel it from the stomach or bitter warmth can be used to help alleviate dryness. When yellow is seen it can be used to relieve bitterness. When yellow and white are combined or gray and white it can still be used to lift it to reach the lungs and it cannot be mistaken There are many Yangming syndromes but few Taiyin syndromes and the ruler still uses bitterness to lower the Xin Tong supplemented by the Xin Dan. "He Lianchen also said " Sticky and damp heat fighting with tangible dregs also advocate for slowing down and moving grinding and swinging.

It is mostly absorbed by yang pathogens such as wind heat warmth and heat from the mouth and nose and internally transmitted to the lung and stomach qi. It has not been resolved for a long time consuming lung and stomach fluids leading to the transformation of dryness and fire. It can be seen in the middle stage of new sensation and warm heat and can also be seen in the period of qi accumulation and heat heat exhaustion. The disease is still shallow and if treated properly there are still few changes in symptoms. If delayed and untreated it is also inevitable to collapse causing people to engage in human blood and reverse the transformation of the heart. The syndrome of lung and stomach dryness and fire is characterized by the accumulation of dryness and fire in the upper middle and two jiao. Its pathogenesis is mild with upper disturbance of qi and severe with steaming and burning of body fluids. If there is no clear solution every time there is a danger of both qi and blood burning; If you have been in love for a long time and cannot understand it you will inevitably damage the residual qi and liquid which is a sign of righteousness deficiency and evil. If there is a mistake there will be a phenomenon of excessive evil and internal closure a lack of proper qi and a change of syncope and detachment. Lung and stomach dryness fire syndrome where the dryness fire is burning and consumes the lung fluid and stomach fluid. Therefore its treatment principle is always to be bitter sweet cool and moist clear and clear the lungs and stomach. It can even be used to reduce bitterness and clear the lower body causing the dry fire to descend in order to preserve the body fluid and there is no worry of internal depression when the body fluid is stored. For those who have not yet established their evil spirit it should be primarily clear. As He Lianchen once said "When the evil energy of Shangjiao is activated the weather decreases and the earth\'s qi naturally moves with it." Therefore clearing can also be used for clearing and venting.

It is commonly known as yang ming fu syndrome. The pathogenic heat of the six exogenous factors is transmitted to the gastrointestinal tract competing with the dross in the intestines dissipating and burning intestinal fluids and transforming dryness into fire. Internal injuries can transform from food to heat and can also transform from dryness to fire. The transmission of evil through the gastrointestinal tract is in accordance with the pathogenesis of the disease. The ancients said: "Yang Ming has no recurrence" which means that evil can be transmitted through the gastrointestinal tract and can be discharged along the intestine without any further transmission. However if the treatment is not appropriate it can be said that the patient should lose the lower part or if the lower part is not properly treated the symptoms may also be complicated and there are many dangerous and serious symptoms such as spasms syncope closure and detachment which can all occur. Gastrointestinal dryness and fire syndrome also known as the syndrome of Yang Ming visceral excess in the Han family is caused by the stomach entering the intestines competing with the dross in the intestines burning the body fluid in the intestines and transforming dryness into fire. Zhang Zhongjing said "This body fluid is dead the stomach is dry and it belongs to Yangming." He also said "Those who do not change their clothes have solid inside and have difficulty defecating are called Yangming. Therefore it is called "there are dry arrows in the stomach". However Yu Genchu once said "Wherever the pathogenic factors of typhoid fever are transmitted to the body and the heat of warm heat diseases accumulates in the body they all belong to the Yang Ming viscera syndrome " which is a syndrome of both typhoid fever and warm diseases. There is also a syndrome where heat accumulates in the diet due to internal injuries enters the intestine from the stomach and transforms dryness into fire. Although the condition is slightly delayed its pathogenesis is different. Although the family of miscellaneous diseases does not directly state their Yangming visceral syndrome Zhongjing once said "Therefore those who are naturally have their own accommodation and food. Therefore the Yangming viscera syndrome must be accompanied by the accumulation of heat in the stomach. Gastrointestinal dryness and fire syndrome in terms of its pathogenesis is characterized by mild and mild pathogenic factors but it ignites in the upper energizer disturbs the clearing of qi and is caused by its burning nature. It is commonly seen in diseases of internal injury and heat accumulation in the diet. Those with severe pathogenic factors and acute symptoms are often symptoms of external infection caused by seasonal diseases. Among them there are also shallow and deep divisions: those with shallow pathogenesis but they burn at the Yang Ming Qi division initially burning the Jin Qi and later consuming the gas and liquid; Those with a deeper pathogenesis have a deeper Yang Ming blood fraction which is a syndrome of Qi and blood intermingling. If one remains trapped for a long time they may become deeply trapped in the Yin system either due to Qi Yin or Yin blood leading to the depletion of the injured Yin fluid. However the changes in symptoms are often caused by the lack of treatment and mistreatment: either the current situation is lost or the situation is not handled properly resulting in a delay in timing. The evil fire is fiery the body fluid dissipates day by day the vitality is depleted day by day the evil substance is positive and weak and the evil substance can turn closed to syncope and the positive deficiency can cause detachment. Therefore delaying treatment and mistreatment will inevitably lead to spasms syncope closure and detachment.

Diseases often result from overeating spicy and spicy foods as well as the thick taste of sorghum leading to heat accumulation in the spleen and stomach; Or even more susceptible to the heat of external evil winds competing with them consuming body fluids and gradually causing dryness to turn into fire. If it is a disease it may cause or disturb the empty orifices and there may be diseases such as toothache and aphthous ulcers; In the case of moderate digestion of gastric juice there are symptoms of moderate digestion and noise; If the meridians are obstructed horizontally there may be symptoms such as central organs and wind prickly heat which are mostly miscellaneous diseases. The spleen and stomach dryness and fire syndrome is caused by the accumulation of heat in the middle energizer or by external wind heat in the body transforming dryness into fire. Therefore the principle of its treatment is to clear and clear the accumulated heat in order to determine its stagnation and then the dry fire can be eliminated. Therefore Liu Hejian said "Its treatment is to clear and make the qi weak the yang weak and the earth level and heal." Shen Jinao also advocated the method of "guiding it".

Therefore the ancients referred to it as the Shaoyang Fu Syndrome or Shaoyang Yang Ming with two Yang diseases in combination; Evil fire and normal fire are intertwined and gallbladder fire and stomach fire are intertwined. Both the gallbladder and stomach are internal organs so they are called Shaoyang Fu syndrome which is different from gastrointestinal dryness fire syndrome and Yangming Fu syndrome. The syndrome of dampness and fire in the gallbladder and stomach is a combination of dampness and fire in the stomach and wood in the gallbladder. If it is triggered by stomach fire and wood fire the pathogenesis tends to be Yang Ming (stomach) which is a disease of clearing qi in the upper and middle regions. It originates from the evil of Shaoyang and is passed down to Yangming. When gallbladder fire and stomach fire are combined the pathogenesis tends to be biased towards Shaoyang (gallbladder) which is a sign of unfavorable rotation of the Shaoyang pivot. The syndrome of dampness and fire in the gallbladder and stomach is characterized by the return of pathogenic factors from the gallbladder to the stomach and intestines which can lead to a false stomach and intestines as the outlet. The pathogenesis of the disease is also a direct transmission so it is not difficult to clear and solve the problem in one fell swoop Zhang Zhongjing once said "Shaoyang should not sweat. Sweating leads to delirium which belongs to the stomach. If the stomach is harmonious it will heal; if the stomach is disharmonious it will become restless and palpitate However if the current situation is not resolved or if the law is not followed the evil will also change in the gallbladder and internal organs. Its treatment should be based on the principle of dredging and benefiting while also clearing the lower organs. This is the so-called method of reconciliation and clearing and reconciliation and clearing both the lower organs. If you want to quickly eliminate the dryness of the gallbladder and stomach you must use clearing and promoting the lower organs as the law. If the disease is related to the central clearing of qi it is necessary to dredge and benefit its pivot.

It is caused by Yang Ming's warm heat not being able to penetrate from the Qi and nourish the blood and the pericardium is dried up resulting in a severe syndrome of Qi and blood intermingling. It is not suitable for adjustment or delayed treatment and can also lead to changes in spasms syncope closure and detachment. It can also feel warm heat and the mild evil cannot occur immediately. It accumulates in the blood and is triggered by the heat of the stomach's diet transforming dryness into fire Therefore pathologists also refer to it as the syndrome of Yangming Ying Fen. The pathogenesis of the syndrome of dryness and fire in the heart and stomach is the transformation of qi and blood circulation. The syndrome of Qi and Yin burning together is often caused by the error of the new sensation of heat and heat resulting in the rapid change of Qi and Yin and the multiple and urgent symptoms; Those who have a deep accumulation of qi and blood are less prone to outbreaks and are susceptible to mild pathogenic factors. Therefore they cannot immediately become ill and must be triggered by external factors. Therefore their onset is relatively mild but it is difficult to quickly eliminate. However there are also those who engage in human blood and their changes are also urgent and severe so it should be discussed separately. The syndrome of dry heat in the heart and stomach refers to the transmission of stomach heat to the heart and the dry heat is driven by qi and blood.

There are internal and external reasons for it and external reasons are caused by external sensations of warmth and heat evil especially heat evil. The ancients said "Heat is joyful and sad " and fire is transformed by warmth and heat. The evil fire originates from the blood of the host and is often accompanied by the burning of blood which can be seen in warm and hot diseases. The internal cause is often caused by excessive exertion or contemplation or depression which excites the monarch\'s appearance. The fire originates from the internal and is often accompanied by the symptoms of wood fire burning qi and blood and is often seen in miscellaneous diseases. The syndrome of dryness and fire in the heart and liver was referred to as the syndrome of wood and fire in ancient times. Both the heart and liver organs are controlled by the blood but the two are interrelated and their onset must involve the blood. Those who lean towards the heart tend to focus on the heart which is often caused by the same disease as the blood and are often due to external factors caused by the blood of the host. The pathogenesis of the disease is reversed resulting in multiple critical symptoms; Those who lean towards the liver are often caused by internal injuries such as liver gallbladder wood and fire. The disease is mildly mild but it is related to emotions and cannot be easily treated; Or external evil can trigger wood fire and the disease is often urgent and severe but it is easier to regulate and treat. Heart liver dryness and fire syndrome its pathogenesis is not external blood heat internal burning and wood fire internal burning. Therefore the principle of its treatment is to clear the heart and cool blood and to clear and reduce wood fire. Therefore He Lianchen said "When clearing the heart and penetrating the collaterals purging the liver and suppressing the wind. He also said "The wind medicine dries blood and is suitable for great prohibition. Even if the bitter taste sinks cold it does not go straight through the intestines and stomach. It dissipates the bitterness and warmth and only robs the stomach juice it should be a great prohibition. The syndrome of fiery blood division has been regarded as a bad disease since ancient times.

Evil fire affects the heart and kidneys with the heart governing blood and the kidneys governing true yin. When the fire shines on the heart and kidneys the yin blood is depleted resulting in a syndrome of water deficiency and fire hyperactivity. The ancients called it: the true yin is exhausted and the strong fire reignites. Or it may be caused by external heat and heat internal depression of the heart and kidney or external wind and cold internal accumulation of yin stagnation and heat and severe heat that can damage and consume yin and blood or even more due to the deficiency of yin and excessive fire in the human body the combination of internal and external evil and the transformation of dryness and fire. It is a disease biased towards the heart resulting in a syndrome of excessive blood and heat and biased towards the kidney resulting in yin injury and fiery heat. Due to its damage to the yin and blood of the heart and kidneys the king fire that excites the heart the fire of the dragon phase in the kidneys the intersection of evil fire and normal fire the yin injury leads to excessive fire and excessive fire leads to the exhaustion of yin thus leading to multiple dangerous malignant transformation syndromes.

Yu Genchu also said "Avoid recklessness and publication. It is urgent to clear the interior and save yin and to quickly purge the heat of mutual steaming to store yin fluid.

It is often caused by the sensation of warm heat dryness heat and external evil in the body delaying treatment and transforming fire to damage yin and consume fluid. It is also known as yin deficiency and excessive fire. However it is different from the cause of deficiency fire which leads to fire due to deficiency. Compared to those who are not caused by deficiency when the evil fire is ignited internally and the lung and kidney yin fluids are injured day by day if not treated properly the source of the evil fire will have the potential to be extinguished and the yin fluids will be at risk of becoming chronic. The syndrome of lung and kidney dryness and fire is characterized by the coexistence of fire and yin deficiency in the lung and kidney yin fluids. The pathogenesis is characterized by the coexistence of fire and yin deficiency with shallow cases dissipating and burning yin fluids deep cases dissipating and drying up true yin. The kidneys store the true water of the sky and the lungs are the source of water above the water. The dryness and fire dissipate and burn the lung and kidney and the lower part of the kidney water and the upper part exhausts and dissipates the source. If the treatment is not appropriate there is a tendency for the source to be extinguished and the true yin is at risk of being dried up; The Yin fluid will be exhausted and the Yang fire will be solely hyperactive. Yin will not benefit Yang and there is also a concern of sudden withdrawal of Jue Yang. Lung and kidney dryness and fire syndrome where both fire and yin wither together. To save yin one must first eliminate its fire. Therefore its treatment principle should always be to clear the lungs and kidneys clear fire and nourish dryness in order to save the yin fluid of the lungs and kidneys.

One method should be to combine sweetness and bitterness to transform Yin Qi. In addition clearing the source and purifying the flow is also a great method for treating lung and kidney dryness and fire.

For those with deep diseases there is also a method of nourishing the kidney and transforming the source by infusing water above that is Sun Langchuan said "Invigorating the kidney and infusing water above nourishing and transforming the source to increase body fluid.

It must be caused by the fact that the person already has liver fire and feels warm and hot qi attacking the lungs or when cold is trapped in the lungs and prolonged depression is also caused by the fire triggering liver fire and combining to form a disease; The liver fire goes against it and helps the evil fire to burn the lung\'s gold so it is known as wood fire attacking the lung and wood fire punishing the gold. The syndrome of liver and lung dryness and fire in which the lung governs qi and the liver governs blood is always characterized by the intermingling of liver and lung qi and blood or the activation of liver fire by lung fire. It is a syndrome of qi and blood often accompanied by external pathogenic factors or liver fire ascending against the lungs. It is a syndrome of blood and qi and is often caused by internal liver qi diseases; If caused by external pathogens the disease is often urgent and severe but treatment is appropriate and not difficult to quickly resolve; The disease caused by liver qi itself is often caused by wood fire and its symptoms are often urgent and severe and it is difficult to quickly resolve. If there is a delay it will eventually become the root of strain. The syndrome of liver and lung dryness and fire always belongs to the syndrome of wood fire invading the lungs and the intersection of qi and blood. Therefore its treatment principle should always be to calm its wood fire clear both qi and blood purge the liver and clear the lungs which is its major method. Fei Boxiong said "Liver fire accumulates and suddenly invades the lung acupoints causing inflammation and forcing blood to rise." Therefore Yu Genchu advocated for "purging fire and clearing gold to protect the lungs " mainly to purge the liver so that wood fire does not invade the lungs. However clearing the lung can also calm the liver and the so-called clearing gold can alleviate wood. Clearing the liver and clearing the lung is not contradictory and ultimately it is necessary to nourish yin and soften the liver to promote the afterlife.

The syndrome of stagnation in the lung and stomach and transforming fire is the fundamental disease of upper and middle stagnation and fire. The disease is mainly caused by the lung and stomach and is referred to as the Sun Yang Ming Syndrome or Yangming Disease or Warm Epidemic. Warm heat stagnates the lungs and stomach and there is also this syndrome of not venting. Stagnation cannot be resolved and the internal fire turns to blazing which can also become a state of incandescence. The blood and hair spots of people with depression and fire are called yang toxins; Sinking of the human intestine can turn into dysentery with some cases of external closure and internal detachment. The syndrome of lung and stomach stagnation and fire refers to the stagnation of external pathogenic factors in the lung and stomach the stagnation of stomach yang for a long time leading to the transformation of fire the initial stagnation of qi in the upper energizer and the clearing of qi the loss of external and internal qi in the circulation and the inability to vent the stagnation of fire. The Buddha is stagnant inside and outside; Even if it carries the qi of the lungs and stomach upwards the qi mechanism may rise but not fall. If there is a slight delay the gloomy fire will turn from fiery to vigorous and the qi will force blood. In the drama the gloomy fire will rush up and down and there is also a risk of internal closure and external detachment. The syndrome of lung and stomach stagnation and fire is always a syndrome of external evil invagination and qi stagnation and fire. Therefore its treatment principle should always be based on the principle of promoting depression and releasing fire with the method of promoting the stagnation of the upper jiao qi and clearing the lung and stomach to suppress fire. This is what ancient people called: evil is in the chest and diaphragm and it is advisable to open it to promote it in order to release heat evil between the chest and diaphragm; If Qi stagnation cannot be opened then the fire will not fall. Therefore Xie Yinglu said "Attack its sweat and evil can be fully reached.

If it is a disease then the three jiao will lose control and if it is in the upper jiao then the clear qi and tranquility will be lost. If it is in the middle jiao then the clear yang qi and Buddha will be stagnant and if it is in the lower jiao it will often cause the turbid qi in the intestine to reverse and the clear qi in the spleen and stomach will not rise As a result there is a period of reverse chaos in the middle qi so although the fire is stagnant in the middle jiao all three jiao are affected. The syndrome of spleen and stomach stagnation of fire where the spleen and stomach are located in Zhongzhou is the center of the three jiao. Therefore the stagnation of fire in the middle jiao will inevitably affect the three jiao. Therefore although the principle of its governance should still follow the principle of "the stagnation of fire" it is still advisable to divide the three jiao systems as Yu Genchu once said: "First open the upper part then disperse the middle part and finally drive the lower part."

The stomach heat is superior causing it to invade the envelope and even blinding the heart and mind. Therefore Zhang Zhongjing said "If it goes down the stomach becomes empty and the qi moves the diaphragm. Yu Genchu once said "The Qi of the heat of the guest is multiplied by deficiency and sinks between the heart and stomach meridians." The heat evil invades the heart and chest and cannot spread over and the fire occupies the pericardium. "This is the stuffy syndrome of the stagnation of heat in the meridians." The pathogenesis of the heart and stomach stagnation of fire syndrome is always due to the stagnation of heat in the heart and stomach meridians and the disease is in the upper jiao.

The disease is caused by depression in the liver and gallbladder which leads to a lack of vitality in the liver a failure in the rotation of the gallbladder and internal organs and the inability to release the internal stagnation of wood fire. Alternatively it is caused by the transformation of external evil into heat which accumulates in the liver and gallbladder and the stagnation and fire are transformed by prolonged stagnation. As Yu Genchu once said "Evil heat is transmitted to the Jueyin meridian syndrome and this yang meridian heat is also transmitted to the foot yin meridian standard disease. Alternatively due to the usual preference for greasy substances and the pungent roasted taste internal heat accumulates in the liver and gallbladder which can also lead to internal stagnation of wood fire and become a syndrome of liver and gallbladder stagnation of fire. The pathogenesis of liver and gallbladder stagnation and fire syndrome is always due to the stagnation of qi in the liver and gallbladder and the inability to release wood fire. However stagnation and fire are the main pathological changes ranging from mild external stagnation and internal steaming to severe external stagnation and internal burning. Initially the burning vapor is divided and for a long time it will inevitably change from qi to blood resulting in the exchange of qi and blood. The liver and gallbladder stagnation and fire syndrome whether caused by external factors internal factors or a combination of internal and external pathogenic factors is mainly characterized by qi stagnation and fire. Therefore its treatment principle should be based on the principle of soothing the liver and gallbladder and also on the method of clearing and reducing wood fire.

This not only leads to the decline of vital energy in the spleen and stomach but also leads to a strong heart fire. If one\'s heart fire is also yin fire" ("Spleen and Stomach Theory"). However the so-called "heart fire" in Dongyuan should be stomach fire. Not only does Dongyuan have the saying that "stomach diseases result in short breath and less energy leading to great heat" but the "Neijing" has also mentioned that "some people are tired their body qi is weakened their valley qi is not abundant their upper jiao is not effective their lower abdomen is blocked their stomach qi is hot and their hot qi is smoked in their chest so they are called internal heat". From this it can be seen that due to the deficiency of the form qi and the deficiency of the valley qi the upper jiao cannot function and the lower wan cannot function. The qi of the clear yang is stagnant in the stomach and the stomach yang generates heat and transforms fire Therefore in the case of spleen and stomach deficiency fire syndrome the pathogenesis is always due to the weakness of the spleen and the transformation of stomach yang into fire. The spleen is the wet soil and the stomach is the dry soil so the beginning is the mutual victory of dryness and dampness. The spleen and stomach are at odds and if they do not rise they will inevitably cause the clear qi to not rise and even sink. If they do not recover over time the spleen yang will also decline and the deficiency yang will lose its convergence and float upwards. Therefore in the Eastern Wall there is a saying that "the beginning is the heat center" and "the end is the cold center" The saying is: Spleen and stomach deficiency fire syndrome the fire is caused by insufficient spleen qi the clear yang qi is lost in the ascending movement and the stagnation in the stomach generates heat and transforms into fire. Therefore its treatment principle should always be to replenish the spleen and elevate the clear yang. Qingqi rises turbid yin decreases stomach yang is not depressed and its fire self converges. Therefore bitter cold is prohibited but sweet and warm are used. This is the method of "sweet and warm removing great heat" in Dongyuan.

Evil fire is deeply trapped in the yin blood causing the yin blood to dry up and the liver and gallbladder to lose nourishment causing wood fire to move inside. Zhang Yuqing called it a syndrome of "burning wood fire inside due to yin deficiency". The pathogenesis of liver and gallbladder deficiency fire syndrome always changes from insufficient yin and blood to internal movement of wood fire. Or due to deficiency causing fire it still belongs to normal internal movement and the condition is slightly mild; If the external heat sensation warms the heat and the internal yin blood transforms into fire then the evil fire and the normal fire are intertwined and the disease is more severe. Mild cases are characterized by symptoms of deficiency and steaming while severe cases are characterized by symptoms of deficiency and burning.

The stomach fire also arises from this resulting in the syndrome of liver and stomach deficiency fire. The liver stomach deficiency fire syndrome is always characterized by yin deficiency and liver fire multiplying the stomach hence it is called yin deficiency and liver dryness yin deficiency and liver transverse jueyang invading the stomach and disharmony between the liver and stomach. The initial onset of the disease is due to both qi and yin injuries. When the wood fire reverses it can cause damage to yin and blood over time. The liver is the main reservoir of blood and if the deficiency fire persists for a long time it will consume and damage the blood; Even if it damages the blood vessels it forces blood to act recklessly; If there is too much blood overflow the qi will detach with the blood and there will be a change in the loss of qi and blood. The liver stomach deficiency fire syndrome starts from yin deficiency loses nourishment due to yin deficiency and then starts from deficiency fire inside causing fire due to deficiency. If the fire is hot the yin will be more disabled. Therefore its treatment principle should mainly focus on nourishing yin fluid with a slight addition of clear solution. Be cautious not to overindulge in bitter cold which can turn dryness into yin damage.

The so-called "strengthening fire and eating qi" can all become liver spleen deficiency fire syndrome. The liver spleen deficiency fire syndrome is characterized by the liver governing blood as yin and the spleen governing qi as yang.

If the spleen\'s vital energy is insufficient then the yin fire will be superior; The deficiency fire of the liver is vigorous and it also consumes energy and damages vital energy; The yang qi of the spleen is weak and it cannot transform into yin blood. Therefore its pathogenesis always belongs to deficiency of both qi and yin and internal steaming due to deficiency of heat. At the beginning the wooden fire tends to win while at the end it consumes qi and blood ultimately damaging qi and yin. The liver and spleen deficiency fire syndrome starts from deficiency so the treatment of fire should supplement its deficiency.

Or due to insufficient yin and blood in the body or due to excessive consideration the dark consumption of yin and blood or the stagnation of anger and injury to the liver the dissipation of burning yin and blood or after a prolonged illness due to heat the prolonged confinement of heat evil the consumption of damaging yin and blood can cause the internal combustion of liver fire dry up the lung gold consume the lung qi burn the lung fluid and damage the lung collaterals. Ancient people also commonly referred to it as the syndrome of wood fire and gold. The liver lung deficiency fire syndrome originates from the deficiency of yin and blood in the liver causing internal combustion of liver fire and burning of lung gold. Therefore its pathogenesis begins with the accumulation of wood fire inside consuming the qi of the lung and damaging the blood vessels of the lung; Continuing to steam and burn the liver lung qi and yin will eventually cause the burning of yin and blood. The liver lung deficiency fire syndrome is always caused by the deficiency of both qi and yin. Liver fire invades the lungs causing the lungs to lose clarity and composure. Therefore its treatment principle is to clear and nourish qi and yin to soften the liver and then the deficiency fire will self extinguish.

The deficiency of yin and blood nourishes the liver and kidney resulting in the phase fire of the liver the dragon fire of the kidney and the internal movement losing storage resulting in the deficiency fire syndrome. Especially when the kidney yin is insufficient to match yang yin does not love yang causing yang to become excessive above resulting in a deficiency fire. In ancient times fire did not return to its roots or yin fire. It comes from the lower jiao yin branch and the fire in the water but it is different from the deficiency yang floating in the kidney yang deficiency. Due to its water deficiency and fire hyperactivity it is also known as a hyperactive dragon. Dragon fire inhabits the water but when it is cold it cannot be hidden and when it is hot it cannot be hidden. Both belong to dragon fire but there are differences in yin and yang. The liver and kidney deficiency fire syndrome is always caused by the deficiency of yin and blood elements in the person or due to overwork or excessive thinking or excessive blood loss during menstruation or damage to the semen in the atrium and ventricle resulting in dark damage to the essence and blood causing fire to move in the middle. Especially in the later stage of heat disease evil heat deeply sinks into the yin dissipates and burns yin blood and evil fire combines with the dragon. Its fire is particularly strong dissipating yin and consuming blood leading to changes in essence marrow and heat. True water consumes every day and water does not make fire. Yin does not match Yang so Yang is overpowering. Fei Boxiong said "Yin deficiency and Yang are overpowering and the fire of dragons and thunder is surging. He Lianchen said "If the fire does not return to its roots it is the fire of the dragon and thunder. Zhu Danxi said "Kidney water deficiency is insufficient and the liver withers and the wood moves. It carries the phase fire again reaching a high peak." He Lianchen also said "Liver and kidney yin deficiency leads to the inversion of phase fire." If it disturbs the heart master it will cause the monarch to lose peace. Insufficient kidney water can cause the wood fire to become excessive. However Wu Kun\'an also said "Shaoyang\'s phase fire is intense pushing Shaoyin back two young people lose their control and the disease and bandits are mild and shallow It is caused by excessive liver fire which can cause kidney water damage. Therefore the deficiency of liver and kidney in fire although there is a tendency towards excessive fire in the liver and a tendency towards ascending dragon fire in the kidney the two are mutually causal. The organs of the liver and kidney mother and child were said to have the same origin in ancient times so it is difficult to completely separate them. The liver and kidney deficiency fire syndrome is based on the deficiency of liver and kidney yin in the lower energizer and the evil fire carries the dragon phase internally. Therefore its governance principle should always nourish its yin and lower its fire. The ancient people called it the method of "strengthening the master of water to control sunlight". However to nourish the kidney yin and replenish its innate water He Lianchen once said "If it is not a soothing and tranquilizing medicine and if there is love in the flesh and blood a large dose of nourishment cannot be used. However due to yin deficiency excessive wood deficiency insufficient kidney water and excessive phase fire it is important to consider the degree of excess and deficiency and determine the urgency of supplementing and reducing qi. Wu Kun\'an once said "It is advisable to relieve the stagnation of wood fire in an urgent manner in order to save the water of Shaoyin.

The cause is lung Qi depression which does not dominate the process of descending and gradually leads to stomach Qi depression. It neither accepts nor descends resulting in both upper and middle Qi stagnation. In some cases lung Qi is not expelled stomach Qi does not descend and cannot regulate the water channel. It is also transmitted to the bladder leading to the failure of kidney qi circulation and unfavorable water channels. The depression of lung qi although located in the upper jiao is related to the pathogenesis of the middle and lower parts. The ancients said that the lungs are the main source of qi in the whole body. When the lung qi is released the qi of each organ is also released. The lung qi is dirty and stagnant and it is advisable to reduce dereliction of duty. If the qi is not released the qi of the three jiao organs cannot be released. The pathogenesis of lung and stomach qi stagnation syndrome lies in the stagnation of lung qi so its treatment principle is mainly to treat the lung. The lungs reside in the upper energizer and are responsible for the descending of qi. When the lung qi is released it can descend to the stomach and pass through the three energizers. Therefore when promoting lung qi then impurity and depression can be eliminated. The method of promoting lung qi should be light rather than heavy as Wu Jutong once said: "The upper jiao is like a feather not light but not lifted." Xu Zhicai also has a method of removing the essence that is using a light and clear substance to promote lung qi.

The disease is caused by spleen and stomach stagnation or depression due to contemplation or stagnation of food leading to stagnation of the Qi mechanism in the middle energizer. The spleen and stomach control the central nervous system and the reason for the rise of clear qi and the decrease of turbid qi all depend on the spleen and stomach central nervous system. The central nervous system is stagnant and the spleen cannot exercise the power to promote health. The stomach qi does not control the decrease of turbid qi and the spleen cannot clear up resulting in the failure of clear up or turbid down. The spleen cannot transform and the stomach does not control the absorption resulting in a mixture of clear and turbid qi. The spleen and stomach are not harmonious and the rise and fall are out of balance. At first the stagnation of qi leads to stagnation and then it consumes the gas and liquid in the stomach ultimately damaging the spleen yang. Even if the spleen is unable to regulate the body fluid of the stomach the qi cannot regulate it and the body fluid stops and turns into water. If the qi is not favorable the water will also not function resulting in a disease of water qi. The spleen and stomach qi stagnation syndrome is a syndrome of qi stagnation in the middle energizer. Therefore its treatment principle should follow Wu Jutong\'s principle of "treating the middle energizer as if it were right" urgently dredging and benefiting the central nervous system eliminating the accumulation and stagnation of energy unblocking and lowering the qi mechanism and quickly removing its stagnation. But it is not advisable to attack recklessly. As Yu Genchu once said "If you use attacking medicine to unblock it although it may temporarily be unblocked its closure is beneficial.

The disease is caused by emotional distress or depression or anger that can damage the liver leading to depression of liver qi and loss of its ability to regulate and regulate leading to the stagnation of liver qi commonly known as liver depression which is commonly referred to as qi stagnation syndrome. The qi of liver depression not only affects the internal organs but also affects other organs affecting the spleen and stomach ascending and descending to the lungs and descending to the kidneys all of which are the combined symptoms of liver depression. The liver and gallbladder qi stagnation syndrome involves the gallbladder and internal organs. The liver and gallbladder are originally internal and external organs but still belong to the disease of the internal organs. Mild cases can lead to stagnation of liver qi while severe cases can lead to internal stagnation of qi resulting in stagnation of liver qi. The change is that the liver qi rushes from stagnation to the upper lower and inner and outer parts resulting in a horizontal transformation of liver qi. Over time qi and blood are depleted resulting in a mixture of deficiency and excess and a syndrome of liver qi imbalance. The syndrome of liver and gallbladder qi stagnation is caused by the loss of qi in the liver and stagnation in the internal organs. Therefore the treatment principle follows the "Classic" principle: "Wood stagnation reaches it. When using the qi mechanism of dredging and benefiting the liver to smooth its flow and restore its ability to relieve stress; However the stagnation of liver qi originates from the imbalance of the seven emotions.

At the beginning there is qi stagnation and blood stasis and at the end there is qi and blood stasis; Prolonged illness leads to a lack of vitality in the liver incompetence in spleen health dark depletion of liver blood and spleen qi resulting in a mixture of qi and blood deficiency and excess; Even if qi stagnation cannot regulate body fluids it can lead to cessation of water flow. If blood stasis persists for a long time it can also dissolve water. At the beginning the fluid qi does not dissolve and the water qi overflows and becomes swollen; For a long time the combination of qi and blood stasis leads to a critical state of qi enveloping blood bloating. The liver spleen qi stasis syndrome starts with the liver and ends with the spleen. Therefore its treatment principle should mainly focus on relieving stagnation of liver qi and if liver qi is relieved it has the power to relieve stagnation and can regulate the qi stagnation of the spleen; Moreover the flow of qi and blood can also flow and qi stagnation can flow smoothly and blood stasis can also follow suit. If blood stasis is already present the product of promoting blood circulation and eliminating blood stasis should also follow then there will be no stagnation of qi and blood and naturally there will be no changes in body fluid stagnation and dehydration; If water is formed and Qi and blood stasis are intertwined with water one should also follow the method of the "Inner Canon": "Evil blood does not flow out the breast should be retained to stop the day should be beneficial and it can be directed down.',tongueConditionList:["whitish glossy ciating of the tongue","Lingual dullness","Thin red tongue coating","Lingual ecchymosis","Lingual cyanosis","pale and dingy tongue with white fur"],pulseConditionList:["taut and slippery pulse"]},{id:141,name:"Syndrome of Heart and Liver Qi Stasis",alias:["Blood stasis","Blood Aster on the Top",""],symptoms:["Chest pain","Stabbing pain","Left shoulder and arm pain","Pain in the elbow and wrist line within the arm","Full of annoyance and shortness of breath","Chest tightness belching and dull pain","Suffocation","breathe hard","Lower limb swelling and fear of cold","Chest and hypochondriac pain","Left anterior chest area suffocation","be short of breath","Impatient and tired","A slight strain leads to an attack of angina pectoris","abdominal distension and fullness","Slightly dull complexion","Eyes dry and shy","numbness of the extremities","insomnia wtth restlessness","Palpitations (especially at night)","Premature palpitations"],description:'Heart Liver Qi Stasis Syndrome is a disease caused by liver stagnation and blood stasis often caused by emotional distress and stagnation of liver qi gradually leading to liver blood stasis.

This is a syndrome of liver stomach qi stagnation and phlegm stagnation. The liver stomach qi phlegm syndrome has three pathogenesis: firstly it invades the chest causing stagnation of the clear yang qi and in some cases stagnation of the clear yang qi in the chest ultimately leading to stagnation of the clear qi often resulting in chronic disease of choking and diaphragm; The second offense is to invade the stomach organs. If the stomach qi is shallow it will lose its balance and decrease. If it is deep it will stagnate the stomach yang. If it lasts for a long time it will consume the yang qi of the stomach or damage the stomach qi and gastric juice. Eventually it can lead to blood loss and damage to the stomach meridians; If the three stagnation occur in the liver then the wood fire of the liver is a disease. In mild cases the wood fire is stagnant and cannot be released. In severe cases the wood fire rushes upwards causing blood to flow for a long time. However when qi stagnation and blood stasis are observed or the yin blood of the disabled liver is damaged resulting in a combination of deficiency and excess. The liver stomach qi phlegm syndrome is a syndrome of stagnation of liver stomach qi and stagnation of phlegm. Phlegm arises from qi stagnation and the disease originates from qi. Therefore its treatment principle lies in relieving the stagnation of qi in the liver and stomach enabling the liver to relieve stress without stagnation of body fluid and without any reason for phlegm to develop. However phlegm can also stagnate qi. As He Xiushan once said "Phlegm is related to the pulsation of qi and qi is stagnant due to phlegm while phlegm is stimulated by qi."

Initially it is due to the loss of liver qi for relaxation and stagnation in the spleen; Following this the liver fire is filled with internal energy and should not be let out rushing upwards; Even if it is related to the persistent food in the spleen it will turn into fire and become fiery inside. When it becomes solid qi and fire merge into a central focus while when it becomes empty it consumes gas and liquid and when qi and fire dry up it is a sign of a mixture of deficiency and reality. The liver spleen qi fire syndrome is characterized by stagnation of qi and internal fire.

Wu Kun\'an said "Blood coagulates due to cold " which is commonly seen in women during menstruation and childbirth. Occasionally cold qi can cause stagnation in the liver and kidney meridians through the Chongren meridians. Therefore it is commonly seen in dysmenorrhea and amenorrhea during menstruation as well as postpartum blood and qi pain such as the formation of symptoms in cold coagulation which was formerly known as stone mass.

Both can cause blood heat and coagulate blood stasis. The syndrome of heart and liver stasis and heat is divided into two main types: the heart and liver and the pathogenesis is always caused by the accumulation of blood stasis and the internal movement of heart and liver wood fire. Therefore its pathogenesis can be divided into stasis and heat stagnation and stasis and heat accumulation and steaming: stasis and heat stagnation qi and blood lose their circulation wood fire cannot be released mild to qi stagnation outside or rushing up even qi and blood flow up collateral stasis and blood overflow; Or stay between the blood circulation and the meridians of the meridians; If blood stasis obstructs internal prosperity depression suppresses wood fire and stagnates the heart mind liver and soul; Dramatists who experience stasis and blockage of the mind experience a change of syncope. Stasis heat accumulation and steaming are caused by the heat generated by blood circulation which is concentrated within the body. Stagnation heat exchanges and evaporates resulting in the division of qi and blood in the heart liver and liver. Wood fire can also ignite within the body causing it to dissipate and burn the blood leading to excessive circulation of collateral blood; When a playwright's internal blood is burning there is an internal movement of the liver wind which leads to a transformation of the closed mind. The syndrome of heart liver stasis heat is generally caused by the stagnation of blood heat in the blood circulation so its treatment principle should be to clear the blood circulation and cool the blood circulation to eliminate heat and to dissipate blood circulation and promote blood stasis.

Mildly it can stagnate the lung qi or stagnate in the lung meridians or even compete with the qi of the lungs and stomach. This can result in qi and blood stasis in the upper and middle regions known as blood stasis in the chest in ancient times. This syndrome is characterized by blood stasis and overflow in the collaterals and blood flowing with the qi in the upper regions resulting in a syndrome of blood inversion. Alternatively stasis and heat can block the qi of the upper and middle regions to clear yang resulting in a syndrome of closed syncope.

The ancients referred to it as the syndrome of blood stasis and heat in the interior and the gastrointestinal tract as the syndrome of Yangming interior. Stasis heat or stagnation in the stomach meridians resulting in blood stasis and stomach pain; Or it may end up in the stomach as hiccup or bloody diaphragm; Or it may accumulate in the intestines and become stagnant or even develop as intestinal carbuncle.

The disease often starts from flashes falls falls or falls or if a woman's menstrual blood stasis is not pure and stays inside or if a man's semen is corrupted and dirty and accumulates inside it can cause the blood to accumulate and become stagnant heat. In addition typhoid fever and warm heat can transmit scorched blood to the lower body which can also cause stasis such as the heat in the blood chamber of a woman and the recovery of atrial fatigue after illness all of which have this syndrome. Stagnation of blood stasis and heat in the kidney meridians is referred to as low back pain; Stagnant in the liver meridian indicates less abdominal pain; If it is formed in the kidney it can be seen as stone drenching or cloudy drenching; If it is tied to the liver it is a hernia and sagging. The liver and kidney stasis heat syndrome has a mild pathogenesis of stagnation either in the liver meridians or in the kidney meridians or in mutual stagnation with the qi of the liver and kidney. Extreme stagnation can lead to inversion; If it is heavy it will stagnate and accumulate either in the kidneys or in the liver; Stagnation for a long time often damages the liver and kidney yin blood and yang qi resulting in a syndrome of deficiency and excess. The liver and kidney stasis heat syndrome is a syndrome where blood stasis heat accumulates in the lower energizer.

The so-called restlessness of the earth and the lack of vitality in the wood can lead to liver stagnation due to dampness in the spleen. Over time it gradually becomes stasis and heat.

Over time it can lead to dry blood consumption. The liver belongs to wind wood while the spleen belongs to damp soil. The syndrome of liver and spleen stasis and heat is often accompanied by liver wind or spleen dampness. At the beginning of its pathogenesis it is characterized by qi stagnation and blood stasis while the liver and spleen are mainly involved in blood circulation so it is also often associated with stagnation of blood circulation. Stagnation and stagnation can lead to stagnation of qi and blood for a long time and even result in the spleen being unable to transport and store water which is a syndrome of stagnant heat leading to water and qi. There are two types of symptoms: either the liver turns into wood and fire with internal redness exceeding yin and blood; Or dampness of the spleen can damage yang resulting in yang deficiency and stagnation; The principle of treatment should always be to dissipate blood stasis and heat and to promote the circulation of the liver and spleen meridians; Alternatively it can also quench the wind or participate in dampness and dryness to regulate the liver and spleen; Disease is related to emotions and it is more important to cultivate one's emotions and nourish one's character in order to supplement the shortcomings of plants and plants.",tongueConditionList:["tongue with ecchymosis","Edge prickle"],pulseConditionList:["The pulse is thin and astringent","Two inch micro pulse","Two Guan Xian","Two feet deep and astringent"]},{id:166,name:"Syndrome of liver and lung stasis and heat",alias:["Liver wind and lung","Wood qi offends gold","the wood fire damages the metal","Stasis and night sweating",""],symptoms:["a stuffy feeling in the chest","Epigastric chamber","fullness sensation in the chest","Shortness of breath","Chest feels oppressed by heavy objects","Cough with thick phlegm","Discomfort in the rib cage","At the time of Fengyin Mao","Dry cough without phlegm","To the dawn of the day","panting","Spontaneous sweating","asthma","Chest and flank pain","Premenstrual lumbar disease","Stop menstruation","Haemoptysis","Lingering and lingering","Time pink","Time coffee color","Sometimes there are bloodstains","Dry lips and dry throat"],description:'Liver lung stasis heat syndrome is a syndrome of liver stasis heat invading the lung; He is known for his liver stagnation and blood stasis.

The pathogenesis of heat phlegm stagnation in the lungs and stomach can be divided into two types: either stagnation in the lungs or stagnation in the stomach. Depression in the lungs can lead to lung qi. In mild cases qi loss should be reduced while in severe cases it can damage and deplete lung fluid leading to lung failure to clear the market. Its changes: in reality there are changes in lung closure and lung obstruction while in deficiency there are problems with depletion of qi and yang and even the danger of detachment.

Therefore there is often food stagnation and even a fight against intestinal debris with phlegm and fire coming from the stomach to the intestine He Lianchen said Phlegm fire accumulates in the stomach and intestines and if it persists for a long time it becomes trapped between the gastrointestinal membranes and collaterals resulting in stubborn phlegm and old phlegm. It is sticky and firm either condensed from stagnant heat to form phlegm or converted from stagnant drink to turbid phlegm. If the disease is mild it may stagnate in the middle energizer causing disharmony of stomach qi and loss of qi. If it persists it may interfere with the clearing of the digestive tract or cause loss of stomach qi. Its symptoms may include stagnation of the qi in the upper energizer to clear yang or it may flow down to the intestines competing with the dross in the intestines and becoming incandescent in the middle.

Due to excessive dampness and phlegm shock or qi stagnation the internal movement of wood fire can cause dampness and phlegm to cover the pericardium resulting in the syndrome of heart gallbladder phlegm and fire. Wang Xugao replied "Damp heat generates phlegm which is left in the organs of hands and feet with Shaoyang and affects the pericardium." Wu Kun\'an said "Heart qi is deficient and there is latent phlegm inside. Liver and gallbladder wood fire multiply with deficiency and invade the heart." Both are symptoms of phlegm stagnation and fire movement commonly known as phlegm irritability. Due to illness originating from shock it was also known as gallbladder deficiency or heart qi deficiency in ancient times. Phlegm originates from the stomach and there is phlegm dampness in the stomach so it is also known as stomach disharmony. Its mark is in the heart and gallbladder and its origin is still in the stomach. At the beginning of the disease it is due to the weakness of the gallbladder and the deficiency of phlegm. Although it is a syndrome of deficiency in the day it is actually evil stagnation so it often turns into a syndrome of dampness phlegm stagnation and wood fire; There may even be a transformation of closed wood fire. Therefore its treatment principle although it refers to the deficiency of heart and gallbladder qi does not lie in nourishing but in clearing phlegm and fire; Clearing the fire of the heart and gallbladder clearing the phlegm in the stomach ensures that the heart and gallbladder are not deficient and the stomach qi is also harmonious. Therefore He Lianchen said "The method should be to expel phlegm and reduce fire." Yu Genchu also said "By opening hot phlegm with coolness the mind will clear itself."

Spleen and Stomach Water Drink Syndrome: Water drink originates from the spleen and stomach and stagnates in the spleen and stomach. Water is a yin evil which will inevitably stagnate and retreat from the upper middle yang qi or ascend to clear the path with yin occupying the yang position causing the upper jiao to clear the yang position and lose its position; Or if it stops accumulating in the stomach there will be a disharmony of stomach yang and the stomach qi will lose its ability to lower and absorb; Even if it stops accumulating in the spleen the spleen yang is stagnant unable to transport and transform body fluids resulting in indistinguishable water and grain; Its changes may overflow between the skin and muscular striae or accumulate in the abdomen and intestines resulting in swelling; For those who suffer from spleen deficiency for a long time how can Lian Chen say: "Spleen deficiency cannot promote the flow of body fluids to the stomach causing water to accumulate in the membrane and become swollen" which is also a combination of deficiency and excess. The syndrome of spleen and stomach water consumption is characterized by stagnation of spleen and stomach yang qi resulting in the inability of body fluid to dissipate qi and stop accumulating. Therefore its treatment principle should always be to warm and unblock the spleen and stomach yang qi in order to dissipate qi and promote water circulation. Therefore the first major method is to unblock yang which is what Wu Kun\'an said: "It is advisable to use Xin to unblock it. However if the water is too strong it is necessary to urgently expel it and stop the water supply; The so-called drainage lowering and unblocking are based on decision-making.

As Yu Genchu once said "This water and heat stagnation are intertwined in the chest abdomen lungs and stomach. If it accumulates in the chest it is called water accumulation in the chest or chest obstruction. If it accumulates in the lungs it is called branch drinking. If it accumulates in the chest and hypochondrium it is called retention drinking. If it accumulates under the hypochondrium it is called retention drinking. If it accumulates between the skin it is called retention drinking. If it accumulates between the limbs it is also called retention drinking. The Lung Stomach Water Drink Syndrome is characterized by the upwelling of stomach water in the lungs and the clearing of yang qi in the upper middle which bears the brunt. Mild symptoms can lead to stagnation severe symptoms can lead to stagnation and even stagnation.

According to Yu Genchu the syndrome is characterized by "prolonged accumulation of spleen water and retrograde flow in the lungs". It is necessary for a person to have a persistent drink in their spleen or external pathogenic factors such as wind cold and dampness that cause it to rise in the lungs. There are also external pathogenic factors such as wind cold and dampness that cause it to mistakenly nourish the lungs. They may also be affected by heat drink cold water or have a fever when drinking cold water or when drinking alcohol when the wind or when bathing when the wind blows. This can cause the water to move inward in the spleen and overflow in the lungs resulting in the syndrome of lung and spleen water consumption. This syndrome is caused by the sensation of wind and cold and was formerly known as the syndrome of the sun organs or the syndrome of water inversion. Those who drink cold due to heatstroke formerly known as those who drink in the sun. Those who experience heat and dampness are called Taiyin heat and warmth. Seen as a self sweating and night sweating person formerly known as a leak. Those who see swelling are called spleen water. The syndrome of lung and spleen water consumption is always caused by external pathogenic sensations in the lungs which touch the spleen and cause excessive drinking and then spread to the lungs. Mild depression can suppress lung yang leading to abnormal lowering of lung qi; If it is heavy it will stagnate the qi of clearing yang in the upper and middle parts and cannot be propagated inside and outside resulting in the same disease on the surface and inside. The syndrome is characterized by internal stagnation and external overflow of water and qi. At the beginning it is characterized by stagnation of yang qi which cannot transform yin turbidity leading to internal accumulation and external flooding of water and qi. Prolonged stagnation of qi stagnation of body fluids and water and qi and even internal accumulation of water and qi resulting in swelling. The syndrome of lung and spleen water consumption is characterized by the reversal of water consumption in the spleen to the lungs. Therefore its treatment principle should always promote lung qi and release water qi from the surface; Dry the spleen and promote dampness allowing water and qi to flow from below; The combination of sweat and profit is used to determine its water quality which is also the principle of "opening ghost gates and purifying the mansion" in the Inner Canon for water management. However in ancient times the method of pouring out water and spreading it is commonly used such as drinking in the sun during the reign of Zhongjing saying "This summer moon hurts cold water and the water flows through the skin causing it to be scattered with a melon stem. Wu Jutong said "Guadi is gushing out its evil and the heat and dampness are resolved and the clear yang is restored.

It is a syndrome of water drink stopping in the stomach and flowing down into the intestines resulting in gastrointestinal water drink. If it stays in the stomach it is called retention drink. It can stop and suppress stomach yang with water drink and can cause stomach pain formerly known as heartache; Even if it forms a ruffian knot ancient people called it a nest sac; Staying in the intestines is referred to as "staying to drink and wanting to go" by Zhong Jing and in modern times it is called intestinal obstruction with fluid accumulation in the intestinal cavity. The symptoms are very urgent and dangerous. Water drink comes from the stomach which must first accumulate in the stomach to suppress the yang qi in the stomach. If it goes up the stomach yang will become disharmonious and if the stomach qi goes up it will go against the stomach qi leading to the loss of appetite; In the middle it accumulates in the stomach in the light it becomes a ruffian and in the extreme it becomes what the honest officials call a pouch; The lower part accumulates in the intestine As Zhong Jing once said "A person who desires self-interest benefits quickly and the heart becomes firm and full this is the desire to retain and drink. When water stops accumulating in the stomach and intestines light cases can still pass through the yang to transform qi and promote water while heavy cases can use a diuretic to expel it urgently.

It can be caused by liver qi depression liver qi invading the spleen spleen qi stagnation and loss of its ability to transport and transform water. It can also be caused by the stagnation of spleen dampness and internal stagnation which suppresses liver qi and leads to the loss of liver circulation. This can lead to the cessation of body fluid storage and the formation of water consumption syndrome. The main cause of the disease is due to external heat dampness internal emotional disturbance or both internal and external factors resulting in liver and spleen disorders and water qi overflow; Mildly it can stagnate the spleen yang and lose its ability to transport and transform; Even if it stagnates the upper middle yang qi the liver qi becomes turbid and goes against it; The change is that Qi does not transform into Tianjin but into water and water and gas are intertwined resulting in swelling and swelling. The treatment should start with removing water and drinking. For those with mild symptoms the Yang Qi of the liver and spleen should be unblocked to promote water circulation. Wu Jutong advocates "first attacking the Chongqi" and "warming the Chongmai" that is warming and unblocking the liver Yang attacking the Yin turbid and retrograde Qi and "attacking kidney evil" means warming and unblocking the Yang Qi to transform Qi and promote water circulation. For those who are in a strong position their qi and water are intertwined and they should be driven out of water first. Yu Genchu proposed to "divide and eliminate the stagnation in order to eliminate it; once the swelling subsides by 70-8% use Baizhu and Zhongtang to eliminate the root and improve the aftermath". He Lianchen said "In the medicine for treating bloating I add the product of promoting blood circulation and unblocking collaterals.

Water vapor inversion can lead to symptoms such as water inversion dizziness and running dolphin. Water vapor storage can lead to bladder water storage cold shower urinary incontinence decadent hernia and water hernia. The water vapor flows downwards and there is also a symptom of diarrhea due to drinking. Overflow of water and gas can lead to edema while accumulation of water and gas can lead to water bloating cold bloating qi wrapped water bloating and spleen and kidney bloating. Both are caused by the inability of the spleen to produce water and the inability of the kidneys to produce water. The syndrome of spleen and kidney water consumption is always caused by the stagnation of spleen and kidney yang qi resulting in the stagnation of water and stagnation of storage. Water drinking is the evil of yin turbidity. If it stagnates in the spleen the spleen yang will lose circulation and the water will stop in the middle of the jiao; Stagnation in the kidney leads to the loss of kidney yang and the inability to transform qi into water; When water is consumed and stored Yang Qi does not dissipate and it cannot be transmitted to the bladder. In some cases it may reverse and cause the upper trunk to clear the path with Yin occupying the Yang position. Causing its symptoms to change either between the exocrine striae or in the abdomen gathering in the intestinal adventitia; Over time the kidney yang becomes increasingly deficient the spleen yang decays and the yin becomes increasingly turbid resulting in a syndrome of yang decline and yin excess. The treatment of Spleen and Kidney Water Drink Syndrome lies in warming and activating the Yang Qi of the spleen and kidney to assist in its gasification. When gasification occurs the water can be transformed into Qi and move forward. Therefore the principle of "warming" is advocated by Hua Bo Ren and the method of "promoting Yang and promoting water" and "transforming Qi and promoting water" was used by Yu Genchu. If it lasts for a long time the yang qi of the spleen and kidney will gradually decline and the turbid yin will become more abundant which is what Yu Genchu called "spleen and kidney yang deficiency yin turbidity is everywhere". In addition it is necessary to warm and supplement yang to promote yin turbidity.

Over time it generates heat and transforms into fire resulting in the accumulation of heat in the gastrointestinal tract. There is a syndrome of typhoid fever with food intake. Zhong Jing said "Yang Ming and Shaoyang diseases must have a sharp downward movement and those with smooth and numerous veins have a persistent diet." It is the accumulation of heat that decocts the body fluid in the intestines and in some cases it forces the blood meridians to form diarrhea which is called self benefit through food intake or the accumulation of dysentery; Due to the accumulation of heat and the accumulation of internal energy the stagnation and clearing of yang qi can become a syndrome of closed syncope which is also an example of yang syncope. Accumulation of heat stagnates in the gastrointestinal tract and in mild cases it can evaporate and heat up the body fluid; Even if it turns dryness into fire it forms in the middle coke.

Therefore the deficiency of lung and kidney qi syndrome often results in kidney yin deficiency resulting in both qi and yin diseases. At the beginning of its pathological changes it is characterized by deficiency of lung qi weakness in promoting and descending qi and deficiency of kidney qi with no right to absorb qi; If the lung's circulation is abnormal it is powerless to distribute fluid and transform qi; Furthermore the deficiency of both qi and yin in the lungs and kidneys the deficiency of yin and jin and the onset of heat from the inside can lead to the deficiency of qi and yin and the loss of tuberculosis is difficult to avoid. The mild symptoms can lead to qi deficiency and inability to absorb body fluids; Even if it cannot absorb yin blood it becomes a symptom of slipping; Drama on the other hand is exhausted due to the lack of fixation of yin fluid and yin blood resulting in slipping. The kidney is a house of water and fire the extreme of yin deficiency unable to love yang causing fire without returning to its original state and causing yang to float over and become detached. It is characterized by deficiency of lung and kidney qi with frequent changes in exhaustion in the later stage.

Often due to overwork; Or due to excessive drinking and overeating or excessive hunger and satiety; Alternatively if one takes the medicine to subdue and attack it can damage the qi of the spleen and stomach resulting in a syndrome of insufficient qi in the middle. The spleen and stomach are the internal and external organs with spleen qi controlling the rise stomach qi controlling the fall and the central nervous system ascending and descending. They rely entirely on the qi of the stomach to regulate body fluids and differentiate water and grain; If the stomach qi is not strong it cannot control the main body's movements. In some cases there may be symptoms of inversion and loss of control. If the temper is not strong it cannot control the main body's movements. If the water and grain are not divided it may even sink. The spleen is also used as wet soil and belongs to Yin as the viscera; The stomach is a dry soil belonging to the yang organs. If the spleen and stomach are dysfunctional then the dampness and dryness are mutually beneficial; If the stomach yang is too high it will dissipate and burn the body fluid leading to the risk of fluid drying up; If the spleen is weak it will increase in strength and weakness and there will be a change of slipping. Therefore although the treatment principle is always based on tonifying the middle qi the focus of tonifying the spleen is mainly on sweetness warmth and qi while the focus of tonifying the stomach is mainly on sweetness coolness and nourishing fluids; The spleen is a visceral organ that can be replenished and replenished through obstruction and elevation; The stomach belongs to the viscera and the viscera are replenished by tonifying which was referred to as the method of \"tonifying\" by ancient people.

Or the air and liquid in the lungs may cause damage first causing insufficient water to irrigate the kidneys below resulting in insufficient kidney yin. The so-called lung is the source of water above and if the upper source dries up the outflow is also insufficient; Alternatively the deficiency of kidney yin can lead to the deficiency of both qi and yin in the lungs where the kidneys are the organs of water and fire. If the water is deficient the fire will flourish and if the fire is strong it will lead to the rise of punishment and burn the gas and liquid in the lungs. The so-called "son stealing mother qi" transformation can all lead to the syndrome of deficiency of lung and kidney yin. The lungs and kidneys are originally the organs of the mother and child and gold and water should be mutually generated. However due to insufficient kidney yin and excessive kidney fire it will inevitably invade the lung\'s gold. Shallow the clear gold will lose its clarity while deep the lung and kidney qi and yin will be damaged both of which are the roots of fatigue. Lei Shaoyi once said "Fu dryness burns the lungs lung fluid is exhausted and the source above water is not distributed. The kidneys are also dry and lung and kidney yin are deficient. Deficiency dryness arises internally which is most likely to lead to fatigue and timidity. The kidney is the organ of water and fire and the house of yin and yang. True yin is not enough to love yang. Kidney yang has no basis and it will float above. Fire does not return to its original state and there is a fire without roots. If it suddenly soars there is a risk of yuan yin causing stagnation and solitary yang rising and falling off. Therefore the deficiency of lung and kidney yin syndrome can be delayed and untreated. If delayed it can lead to fatigue and injury while if urgent there is a risk of syncope and detachment. He Lianchen said on the day "If you fail to turn back your life will follow suit." This is what Shao Xiangen said: "Yin has already exhausted and Yin and Yang will definitely depart. The deficiency of lung and kidney yin syndrome refers to the deficiency of qi and yin in the lungs and the loss of true yin in the kidneys. Therefore the principle of treatment should always focus on nourishing the lungs and kidneys especially nourishing the kidney yin. As the ancients said "Treating the lungs is not beneficial but the method should be nourishing the kidneys. Lei Shaoyi said "It is necessary to greatly replenish kidney water to calm its fire and protect its gold. If gold is clear then water is active and water is active then gold can be protected. Gold and water complement each other and there is no danger of starting a prairie fire." This method of replenishing water and generating gold. However Yin Qi is depleted and Yang Qi rises alone. Yin cannot be maintained and Yang cannot be hidden. Therefore nourishing Yin and absorbing Yang belong to the Great Dharma. When Jun replenishes kidney yin calms down floating yang and consolidates kidney qi as He Lianchen said: "To fill essence with a strong agent one must also calm down yang. Ye Tianshi also said "The root of the Yuan Sea is small not hidden or absorbed. It is important to capture and solidify the truth in order to cure the root cause. He Lianchen further said "The Zhenyuan style emblem is a medicine that can nourish yin and subdue yang when the Dragon Thunder Rebellion is about to break away.

The liver stores blood and the kidney stores essence. After suffering from a serious illness for a long time it may arise from excessive exertion and desire or from indulging in alcohol and lust to consume essence and blood leading to lower energizer yin deficiency. The kidney is the organ of water and fire the house of true yin and true yang. Shen Youpeng said "In the Classic the disease occurs in the kidneys where the kidneys store essence which is the true yin. The true yang also contains the essence. Yang likes to rise and float and is absorbed through yin. If the essence is captured internally then the yang qi has no basis and rises and floats above. Therefore there are multiple syndromes of kidney and yang floating. As the ancients said " The essence and blood are of the same origin and both belong to the yin of the lower jiao. Yin and blood are not enough to nourish the liver so the liver yang is easy to move; If the yin essence is not enough to fill the kidneys then there is less dragon thunder hidden. Ye Tianshi said "The yin of the liver and kidney is exhausted and the wind and yang are shining inside." Shen Youpeng also said "If the essence and blood are sufficient then the liver and yang are attached. There is a saying in the Four Ming Dynasty: "The Yuan Sea has no root and the deficiency is due to the liver and kidney." The liver and kidney have a loss of essence and blood and the Yang Qi cannot return to the root. He Lianchen said "If the fire does not return to the root it is the fire of dragons and thunder. However water and fire coexist in a house where both yin and yang coexist. The single yin does not grow and the solitary yang does not grow. The extreme damage to yin will inevitably affect the true yang; There will eventually be a transformation of yin and yang deficiency with insufficient water and fire; Slow walking can cause fatigue while urgent walking can cause fainting and detachment. Therefore Yu Tinghong said "The Yin fluid has run out and the Yang qi is about to escape." Xie Yinglu said "The disease is the intersection of Yin and Yang and those who intersect will also die." If this intersection of Yin and Yang is completed it will inevitably lead to premature death. The liver kidney yin deficiency syndrome is a syndrome of deficiency of blood yin and essence in the lower jiao yin. The fundamental reason for the disease and congenital deficiency lies in the deficiency of the yuan yin and yuan yang. Therefore the treatment principle is to replenish the essence and nourish the blood in order to nourish the yuan yin of the liver and kidney; However the essence and blood are insufficient and the Yuan Sea has no roots. Therefore it is necessary to use both flesh and blood to nourish and nourish the essence and blood. Yin deficiency leads to yang floating so it should also be used to suppress hidden and floating yang. Therefore Ye Tianshi said "The medicine is taken with calmness and weight and filled with yin to suppress yang; That is what He Lianchen said: "Take in the hidden town take in the qi and return to the original place. If water is depleted fire will flourish which is a rootless yin fire. As He Lianchen said "If fire does not return to its roots it is the fire of dragons and thunder."

Multiple spleen yang systems are insufficient to warm the lungs resulting in deficiency of lung yang.

The lung governs the health and the health qi originates from the middle energizer. Therefore people with weak lung and spleen yang qi cannot externally replenish the health yang resulting in the weakness of the health yang and becoming a syndrome of superficial yang deficiency. If Wei Yang is unable to solidify body fluids it will cause excessive sweating and discharge commonly known as superficial deficiency spontaneous sweating. Night sweating due to superficial deficiency is also an example of spontaneous sweating due to yang deficiency. The yang of the lung and spleen is the foundation of clearing yang in the upper energizer. If the yang of the lung and spleen is deficient it is unable to lift up so there is often no increase in clearing yang. In some cases the sinking of clearing yang occurs also known as the sinking of the middle yang. If Yang deficiency is weak in absorption there may be changes in the discharge of body fluids and the overflow of blood vessels. The deficiency of lung and spleen yang syndrome is often caused by the deficiency of spleen yang first. Therefore its treatment principle should always focus on warming and tonifying the lung and spleen yang qi especially when tonifying the spleen to help the lung and cultivating soil to generate gold.

If the benefits are not closed the Yangming Gate has already been removed." However it is related to the spleen yang so Yu Genchu also said "The spleen yang falls off." In addition the kidney serves as the door for the stomach. If the kidney yang is insufficient it can also cause gastrointestinal yang deficiency Therefore Yu Genchu once said "The kidney\'s life and fire decline the gastrointestinal deficiency and the slip and detachment are not maintained." Yu Genchu also said "The life and fire decline the appetite decreases and the spleen yang falls." It can be seen that the shallow is due to the spleen yang and the deep is due to the kidney yang. Therefore Ye Lin said "When closing the door there is no storage and the warm and nourishing qi is not suitable and the fu qi is about to be extinguished." Therefore its treatment principle is to warm and replenish the yang qi consolidate and close the door in order to thicken the intestines and stomach; Natural diseases are often related to the yang qi of the spleen and kidney so it is necessary to simultaneously strengthen the yang qi of the spleen and kidney in order to receive full benefits.',tongueConditionList:["Tongue is light and smooth without moss","Purple and shiny"],pulseConditionList:["Pulse fine","Six meridians sinking late","Weak pulse","Ru Xiao"]},{id:259,name:"Yang deficiency of the heart and spleen pattern",alias:["of the heart-yang","Asthenia of vital energy","Fire fades and wind moves","Float over","Yang deficiency and wind movement","Stop water due to yang deficiency","Yang Deficiency Bleeding","Heart yang collapse","Yin and Yang are damaged",""],symptoms:["Sallow facial complexion","Drowsy and drowsy","Speech weakness","Slightly chilly","cold limbs","Inaccurate bowel movements","loose stool with indigested grains","Not thinking about food","tastelessness in the mouth and not thirsty","numb limbs and tense tendons","Time palpitations and babbling","mental confusion","You have your own hands and your own heart","Palpitator","general lassitude","a stuffy feeling in the chest","Plus after the event","Palpitations and palpitations","Sleeping restlessly at night"],description:"The syndrome of heart and spleen yang deficiency is characterized by the inability to recover the deficiency of heart and spleen qi which affects the yang of the heart and spleen and leads to the weakness of yang qi.

Due to the deficiency of kidney yang element the fire of the vital gate cannot warm and steam the middle energizer resulting in insufficient spleen yang and powerless circulation resulting in internal injury of spleen and kidney yang deficiency syndrome. The ancients said "It is often seen in the generation of wine and lust." He Lianchen said "Wine dampness harms the spleen lust harms the kidneys. During the course of the illness excessive use of cold and cold energy can deplete the yang qi of the spleen and kidney. He Lianchen said "A large dose of medicine is used to treat the spleen and kidney constantly advancing and striving for quick recovery. The first dose is less effective and the spleen and kidney yang will be damaged for a long time. However the use of attack and elimination will further damage the kidney yang and seriously damage the qi. The disease cannot be cured at this point. Long term illness can also lead to spleen and kidney yang deficiency. The Inner Canon states: \'Ying Chu Zhong Jiao\' Wei Chuxia Jiao Therefore the deficiency of yang in the spleen and kidney which cannot be replenished with the external yang leads to yang deficiency on the surface and even damages the yin and wei. The kidney is the innate origin and the spleen is the acquired origin. The deficiency of yang in the two origins cannot stir up and clear yang causing it to fail to lift and sink instead. The deficiency of yang in the spleen has no power to transport and transform qi while the deficiency of yang in the kidney cannot transform qi and water. Over time it becomes water and accumulates causing swelling and swelling which is still an example of yin and water. If the qi cannot be vaporized it becomes cold drenching and deficiency drenching. The deficiency of yang cannot be absorbed but it becomes cave discharge feast discharge and kidney discharge; Kidney deficiency leads to inability to absorb qi spleen deficiency leads to loss of solid absorption and in extreme cases there is no root in the Yuan sea fire does not return to the Yuan state and deficiency yang floats above the upper level resulting in a change of wearing yang and stagnating yang; If the deficiency persists for a long time it will gradually lead to damage to one\'s path. The kidneys are the organs of water and fire. Yin and Yang coexist in the same house and the damage to Yang will not recover. It will gradually reach Yin becoming a syndrome of both Yin and Yang losses. The spleen and kidney yang deficiency syndrome has been damaged for two consecutive days and the foundation of the deficiency syndrome has been shaken. He Lianchen said "The disease is at this point and it cannot be done" "Warm and replenish the spleen and kidney to save residual yang". Therefore the treatment principle should always focus on warming and strengthening the yang qi of the spleen and kidney especially on nourishing the fire of the vital gate and strengthening the yang in the spleen. However the ancients have said that "tonifying the spleen is not as good as tonifying the kidney" or "tonifying the kidney is not as good as tonifying the spleen". After studying their theories both cannot be ignored. Warm and strengthen the kidney yang help the life fire to warm the spleen and soil. "If there is no salary at the bottom of the Busi it is necessary to increase the salary at the bottom of the Busi" to help the spleen yang decompose and transform the water and grain which is the correct method of replenishing fire and generating soil. By warming and tonifying the spleen yang and vibrating the granary the essence of water and grain can be replenished to fill the innate body. The "Inner Canon" claims that "those who obtain grain will prosper" and the ancients said that "if the stomach yang is restored then all yang can be restored". Therefore tonifying the spleen and kidney should be determined based on the severity of the condition and cannot be generalized.',tongueConditionList:["Tongue fat and light texture","putplish dim tongue with whitish coating","flabby tongue","greasy fur","White greasy","Slippery tongue","Slightly dull and slightly plump tongue","pale and dingy tongue with white fur"],pulseConditionList:["an empty pulse with littl strength","small and weak pulse","Meridian moistens fine","Sleek and smooth","The pulse is even weaker by two feet","The pulse is heavy and thin","Ulnar pulse deficiency","weak","slender","sink","onion","The veins are as fine as silk","Pulse imaginary number","Press again to leave blank"]},{id:262,name:"Syndrome of deficiency of liver and kidney yang",alias:["decline of the fire from the gate of life","Asthenic cold of essence","Deficiency cold of the governor vessels","Chong Ren Void","Empty Eight Channels","Lower asthenia and upper sthenia","failure of the kidney in receiving qi","Kidney qi upwardness","Kidney asthenia and unsteadiness","flaming-up of deficiency-fire","Dragon fire rises","Dragon and thunder rise","True Yang Loses","Ge Yang is above","Ge Yang blood loss","Qi collapse following heavy blood loss","True cold with false heat","Arthralgia of meridians","Loss of blood essence","impairment of qi and the blood","yin and yang are both damaged",""],symptoms:["Shape Fat Color Xiao","feeling listless and inert","Fatigue and shortness of breath","Asthenic weakness","Timidity and lack of energy","Low language","Physical decline","Suffering from soreness and pain throughout the body","relative weakness in the loins and knees","Flaccidity and weakness of legs and feet","Unable to stand for a long time","Even more intolerant of long-distance travel","Cold intolerance","Cold rises from the back","Limb hypothermia","Fear of cold below the waist","Form cold and timid cold","Cold in the bone marrow","Even worse at night","Cold Drama Time","Trembling all over","Knee bones to tarsal bones are prone to cold and weakness","coldness and pain in the lower abdomen","Penis or scrotum","Cold but not warm","Mild libido","Impotence","oligospermia","Thin and refreshing","Menstrual disorder","Less color and quantity","Light under the belt","Clear and clean urine","Dark complexion","Lips purple and dull","Lips pale or purple","Mental fatigue","Weakness of spirit and weakness","Forgetfulness","hypomnesis","Palpitations shortness of breath","insomnia and dreaminess","Brain swelling","headache","Headache extends from the top to the forehead","Extremely afraid of the cold","Seeing the wind as straight as a human brain","Mild reduction of temperature","vertigo","Tinnitus","Low back pain and soreness","Low back pain and weak legs","Or cold pain in the waist","Its pain is lingering","When in pain enjoy hand massage","Spinal pain originates from sacral connection to the back","Unable to stand straight","Even the faint sensation of coldness in the spine","My waist is also cold","Like the wind and cold invading people","Low back pain and poor luck","Unable to endure long journeys and standing tall","Joyful Hand Massage","Right buttocks","Lower limb pain","Heavy and indescribable","Difficulty in walking","Heavy fatigue","anaesthesia","relative weakness in the loins and knees","Lumbar pain","Spine brawn waist leg weakness and soreness","Oligoabdominal pain","Costal discomfort","Frequent and frequent urination","Nocturnal polyuria","Nocturnal emissions","Premature ejaculation"],description:"Liver and kidney yang deficiency syndrome is a syndrome of kidney yang deficiency and liver yang deficiency. It is the fundamental disease of deficiency of lower Jiao Yang. Diseases often arise from indulgence that consumes kidney yang; Or for those who have been suffering from ejaculation for a long time the yang qi leaks out with the essence; Years of aging fire decline and exhaustion of essence can lead to the loss of kidney yang the decline of life fire and the inability to nourish the liver. As a result liver yang also declines resulting in the syndrome of liver and kidney yang deficiency. Or due to prolonged exposure to gonorrhea women may experience vaginal discharge and excessive exposure to cold cold and excessive penetration; Or fetal birth imbalance damage to liver and kidney yang qi can also lead to liver and kidney yang deficiency syndrome. The deficiency of liver and kidney yang syndrome originates from the kidney and its pathological changes are often characterized by insufficient kidney yang; If the kidney yang is insufficient the qi will not reach the state capital resulting in insufficient water and fluid; If yang deficiency cannot be absorbed it will cause the body fluid and yin essence to slide and leak; If yang deficiency cannot be absorbed then the kidney qi is reversed; Life and fire decline the Yuan Sea has no roots the true Yang is lost and the fire does not return to the Yuan resulting in the floating of the empty Yang. In some cases the lower and upper realms become empty and there is a change of syncope and detachment. Kidney yang deficiency leads to the decline of life gate fire while liver yang deficiency leads to a lack of vitality; Kidney stores essence liver stores blood and liver kidney yang deficiency cannot transform into essence and blood; The daily consumption of essence and blood blood deficiency cannot fill the camp and yang deficiency cannot vibrate the guard resulting in the loss of camp and guard stagnation of external evil loss of nourishment in the meridians and a change in impotence. The kidney is the foundation of innate nature while the liver is the foundation of a woman's innate nature. It governs the essence and blood while the deficiency of liver and kidney yang leads to passive biochemistry. Therefore the daily consumption of essence and blood is bound to lead to the loss of human life especially in the case of the kidney which is a residence of water and fire. The true yin and true yang cannot be restored and the damage to yang will gradually reach the yin causing both the true yin and the true yang to be damaged. At this point the disease's root is shaken and it is difficult to quickly rise. Therefore the principle of its treatment is always to warm and replenish the yang of the liver and kidney and once the essence and blood have been depleted it is necessary to fill in the essence and blood. This yang generates yin and grows in order to strengthen its underlying elements and strengthen its foundation which is what the ancients called the method of \"filling the underlying elements\". However one should not simply use hardness and dryness as it may consume more essence and blood. They should be selected as the kind-hearted ones to nourish and nourish and then ignite a fire to return to health guiding the sea of dragons and people and hoping for the treatment of yin and yang
